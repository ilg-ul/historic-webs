<H1>Fill-Out Form Example w/ Hidden Elements (#13)</H1>

This is a very simple fill-out form example. <P>

<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/htbin-post/post-query">

A single text entry field goes here: <INPUT NAME="entry"> <P>

There are two "hidden" form elements which are not displayed 
located here:

<INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="hidden element#1" VALUE="blah">
<INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="hidden element#2" VALUE="foobar">
<p>

These are created via TYPE="hidden" and can contain arbitrary NAME/VALUE pairs.
These can easily be used to maintain a form of "state" in multiple
connections with a server. <p>

To submit the query (including hidden data), press this button: <INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="Submit Query">. <P>

Things you may want to note: <P>

<UL>
<li>The hidden elements are not displayed but are not "secret".  They can 
	easily be found via the "View Source" option.  
</UL>
