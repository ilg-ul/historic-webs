<H1>Fill-Out Form Example #5</H1>

This is another fill-out form example, with various text entry field
attributes demonstrated. <P>

<HR>

<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/htbin-post/post-query">

The first text entry field has no special attributes: <INPUT
NAME="entry1"> <P>

The second text entry field is twice as long (displays up to 40
characters, instead of the default 20): <INPUT SIZE=40 NAME="entry2">
<P>

Each of the first two text entry fields can hold as many characters as
the user wishes to type (into the millions).  The following text entry
field, however, is limited to five characters, and beeps when the user
tries to enter more: <INPUT SIZE=5 MAXLENGTH=5 NAME="entry3"> <P>

To submit the query, press this button: <INPUT TYPE="submit"
VALUE="Submit Query">.   <P>

To clear the form, press this button: <INPUT TYPE="reset" VALUE="Clear Form">.

</FORM>

<HR> <P>

<A HREF="example-4.html">Back to example 4</A> or <A
HREF="example-6.html">forward to example 6</A>. <P>
