Things you may want to note: <P>

<UL>
<LI> By default, checkboxes are off.
<LI> When the query is packaged up, off checkboxes are ignored
     completely and on checkboxes are given the values specified by
     the <CODE>VALUE</CODE> attribute in each <CODE>INPUT</CODE> tag.
<LI> Multiple checkboxes can have the same <CODE>NAME</CODE>, if
     desired.
<LI> Checkboxes are very similar in use and interpretation on the
     server side to text entry fields.
<LI> Checkboxes are "n of many": Any number of them can be on or off
     at any time.  (The alternative scheme, "one of many", in which
     only one out of a group of several toggle buttons can be on, is
     not yet supported by Mosaic.)
