<H1>A Beginner's Guide to URLs</H1>

What's a URL?  A URL is a <b>Uniform Resource Locator</b>.  Think of
it as a networked extension of the standard <i>filename</i> concept:
not only can you point to a file in a directory, but that file and
that directory can exist on any machine on the network, can be served
via any of several different methods, and might not even be something
as simple as a file: URLs can also point to queries, documents stored
deep within databases, the results of a <i>finger</i> or <i>archie</i>
command, or whatever.  <P>

Since the URL concept really pretty simple ("if it's out there, we can
point at it"), this beginner's guide is just a quick walk through some
of the more common URL types and should allow you to be creating and
understanding URLs in a variety of contexts very quickly.  <P>

<H2>File URLs</H2>

Suppose there is a document called "foobar.txt"; it sits on an
anonymous ftp server called "ftp.yoyodyne.com" in directory
"/pub/files".  The URL for this file is then:  <P>

<PRE>
    file://ftp.yoyodyne.com/pub/files/foobar.txt
</PRE>

The toplevel directory of this FTP server is simply:  <P>

<PRE>
    file://ftp.yoyodyne.com/
</PRE>

The "pub" directory of this FTP server is then:  <P>

<PRE>
    file://ftp.yoyodyne.com/pub
</PRE>

That's all there is to it.  <P>

<H2>Gopher URLs</H2>

Gopher URLs are a little more complicated than file URLs, since Gopher
servers are a little tricker to deal with than FTP servers.  To visit
a particular gopher server (say, the gopher server on
gopher.yoyodyne.com), use this URL:  <P>

<PRE>
    gopher://gopher.yoyodyne.com/
</PRE>

Some gopher servers may reside on unusual network ports on their host
machines.  (The default gopher port number is 70.)  If you know that
the gopher server on the machine "gopher.banzai.edu" is on port 1234
instead of port 70, then the corresponding URL would be:  <P>

<PRE>
    gopher://gopher.banzai.edu:1234/
</PRE>

<H2>News URLs</H2>

To point to a Usenet newsgroup (say, "rec.gardening"), the URL is
simply:  <P>

<PRE>
    news:rec.gardening
</PRE>

Currently, network clients like <A NAME=1
HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/help-about.html">NCSA
Mosaic</A> don't allow you to specify a news server like you would
normally expect (e.g.,
<code>news://news.yoyodyne.com/rec.gardening</code>); this may be
coming down the road but in the meantime you will have to specify your
local news server via some other method.  The most common method is to
set the environment variable <code>NNTPSERVER</code> to the name of
your news server before you start Mosaic.  <P>

<H2>HTTP URLs</H2>

HTTP stands for HyperText Transport Protocol.  HTTP servers are
commonly used for serving hypertext documents, as HTTP is an extremely
low-overhead protocol that capitalizes on the fact that navigation
information can be embedded in such documents directly and thus the
protocol itself doesn't have to support full navigation features like
the FTP and Gopher protocols do.  <P>

A file called "foobar.html" on HTTP server "www.yoyodyne.com" in
directory "/pub/files" corresponds to this URL:  <P>

<PRE>
    http://www.yoyodyne.com/pub/files/foobar.html
</PRE>

The default HTTP network port is 80; if a HTTP server resides on a
different network port (say, port 1234 on www.yoyodyne.com), then the
URL becomes:

<PRE>
    http://www.yoyodyne.com:1234/pub/files/foobar.html
</PRE>

<H2>Partial URLs</H2>

Once you are viewing a document located somewhere on the network (say,
the document <code>http://www.yoyodyne.com/pub/afile.html</code>), you
can use a <i>partial</i>, or <i>relative</i>, URL to point to another
file in the same directory, on the same machine, being served by the
same server software.  For example, if another file exists in that
same directory called "anotherfile.html", then
<code>anotherfile.html</code> is a valid partial URL at that point.
<P>

This provides an easy way to build sets of hypertext documents.  If a
set of hypertext documents are sitting in a common directory, they can
refer to one another (i.e., be hyperlinked) by just their filenames --
<i>however</i> a reader got to one of the documents, a jump can be
made to any other document in the same directory by merely using the
other document's filename as the partial URL at that point.  The
additional information (access method, hostname, port number,
directory name, etc.) will be <i>assumed</i> based on the URL used to
reach the first document.  <P>

<H2>Other URLs</H2>

Many other URLs are possible, but we've covered the most common ones
you might have to construct by hand.  At the top of each Mosaic
document viewing window is a text field called "Document URL"; if you
watch the contents of that as you navigate through information on the
network, you'll get to observe how URLs are put together for many
different types of information.  <P>
