                                A TELNET SERVER
                                       
   A public telnet server allows anyone to telnet to you and run a WWW
   client program to get at data. We run one on info.cern.ch.
   
   We assume here you know what you are doing and so here are a few
   points to remember in outline only.
     * Beware of secuity holes at all times.
     * Make a special unpriviliged user
     * You can set www up as the user's shell.
     * Run www with the -h option to turn off recursive telnet hopping
       for secuity. Also turns off shell escape, pipe, file save, etc.
     * We use a special /bin/login command which obviates the need for a
       shell, a no-password user, and for username or password prompts.
       Available on request.
     * Please mail www-request@info.cern.ch to get your server added to
       the list of tenet access points to the web. It is useful to have a
       complete list of these so people can log onto the nearest one when
       away from home, to cut network usage.
       
Skipping the shell

   The special /bin/login program is like login but if the guy has not
   telnetted in with a command line user name which matches one on the
   host, he is thrown into www directly without using a shell or
   collecting $200. This means that if he find some way to crash www, he
   is bound to exit rather than accidentally get a shell.
   
   The login_www program which replaces login passes a -h ip.ip.ip.ip
   option to www which tells www where the call is coming from (www logs
   all transactions and also login_www logs the session for safety).
   
   This makes the machine difficult to acces for normal purposes
   especially if rlogin is disabled for security reasons too. Only some
   machines (Ultrix, NeXT, ...) support telnet -l username which is
   necessary to get in.
   
Changes in browser behaviour

   When www gets the -h option it behaves differently, mainly for
   secuity. (The HTSecure flag is set within the library).
     * It disallows any telnet hopping -- you can't use a public www
       server to "launder" your telnet access for hacking by telnetting
       on to some other site. (See HTTelnet.c)
     * It disallows shell spawning, printing, saving files etc etc. . It
       also requires a full "quit" rather than just "q" to exit.
       (HTBrowse.c)
     * It uses a different home page, see below.
     * It logs all access by default.
       
  HOME PAGE
  
   When www is used with the -h option, the home page is set by the
   WWW_HOME environment variable as usual. If you are using the special
   ligin program, then there is no shell script in which to set this. The
   browser therefore checks, is WWW_HOME is not set, for a file
   /etc/www-remote.url. If that file exits, it reads from it the URL of
   the home page. Note that the home page cannot be a local file, as
   local file access is turned off for security reasons. It must be a
   document availableon the network, from your own or someone else's
   server.
