<h1>Lynx Users Guide Version 2.3</h1>

Lynx is a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for users
running cursor-addressable, character-cell display devices (e.g.,
vt100 terminals, vt100 emulators running on PCs or Macs, or any
other "curses-oriented" display).  It will display hypertext
markup language (HTML) hypertext documents containing links to
files residing on the local system, as well as files residing on
remote systems running Gopher, HTTP, FTP, WAIS, and NNTP servers. 
Current versions of Lynx run on UNIX and VMS.  A DOS version is in
development.<p>
Lynx can be used to access information on the World Wide Web, or
to build information systems intended primarily for local access. 
For example, Lynx has been used to build several Campus Wide
Information Systems (CWIS).  In addition, Lynx can be used to
build systems isolated within a single LAN. <P>

<h2><A NAME="1">Viewing local files with Lynx</A></h2>
Lynx can be started by entering the Lynx command along with
the name of a file to display.  For example these commands could
all be used to display an arbitrary ASCII text file. 

<dl>
 <dt>UNIX
  <dd><code>lynx myfile</code>
  <dd><code>lynx /home/my-dir/myfile</code>
 <dt>VMS
  <dd><code>lynx dua5:[my-directory]myfile</code>
</dl>

When executed, Lynx will clear the screen and display as much of
the specified file as will fit on the screen.  Pressing a
down-arrow will bring up the next screen, and pressing an up-arrow
will bring up the previous screen. If no file is specified at startup,
 a default file will be displayed.  (The default is configured by the 
system administrator when the command is installed.)<p>

Lynx will also display files written in the HyperText
Markup Language (HTML), if the file's name ends with the
characters ".html".  HTML is a file format that allows users to
create a file that contains (among other things) hypertext links
to other files.  Several files linked together may be described as
a <i>hypertext document</i>.<p>
For example, these commands could be used to display files
containing HTML hypertext:

<dl>
  <dt>UNIX
     <dd><code>lynx myfile.html</code>
     <dd><code>lynx /home/my-dir/myfile.html</code>
  <dt>VMS
     <dd><code>lynx dua5:[me]myfile.html</code>
</dl>

When Lynx displays an HTML file, it shows links as "bold face"
text, except for one link, which is shown as "highlighted" text. 
Whether "boldface" or "highlighted" text shows up as reverse
video, boldface type, or a color change, etc. depends on the
display device being used (and the way in which that device has
been configured).  Lynx has no control over the exact presentation
of links.<p>
The one link displayed as "highlighted" text is the currently
"selected" link.  Lynx will display the file associated with the
selected link when a right-arrow or a Return key is pressed.  To
select a particular link, press the up-arrow or down-arrow keys
until the desired link becomes "highlighted," and then press the
right-arrow or Return key to view the linked information. 
Information included in the HTML file tells Lynx where to find the
linked file and what kind of server will provide it (i.e.  HTTP,
Gopher, etc.). <p>

When a binary file is encountered Lynx will ask the user if
he/she wishes to download the file or cancel. If the user
selects 'D' for download, Lynx will transfer the file into a
temporary location and present the user with a list of options. The
only default option is "save file to disk", which is disabled
if Lynx is running in anonymous mode. Any number of additional 
download methods may be defined in the lynx.cfg file by the system 
administrator. Programs like kermit, zmodem and FTP are some possible
options. <A HREF="#TOC">ToC</A>

<h2><A NAME="2">Lynx online help</A></h2>
Online help is available while viewing any document.  Press the
'?' or 'H' key to see a list of help topics.  See the section
titled <A HREF="#6">'Navigating hypertext documents with Lynx'</A> for 
information on navigating through the help files. <A HREF="#TOC">ToC</A>

<h2><A NAME="3">Leaving Lynx</A></h2>
To exit Lynx use the 'q' command.  You will be asked whether you
really want to quit.  Answering 'y' will exit and 'n' will return
you to the current document. Use 'Q' or CTRL-D to quit without verification.
<A HREF="#TOC">ToC</A>

<h2><A NAME="4">Starting Lynx with a Remote File</A></h2>
If you wish to view a remote file (that is, a file residing on
some computer system other than the one upon which you are running
Lynx) without first viewing a local file, you must identify that
file by using a Uniform Resource Locator (URL).  URL's take the
general form:
<br><br>
 <code>PROTOCOL :// HOST / PATH / FILENAME</code>
<br><br>

where

<dl>
   <dt><code>PROTOCOL</code>
	<dd>identifies the communications
 	protocol used by the server that will provide the file.  As
 	mentioned earlier, Lynx (and any WWW client) can interact with a
 	variety of servers, each with its own protocol. 
   <dt><code>HOST</code>
	<dd>is the Internet address of the computer
 	system on which the server is running, and
   <dt><code>PATH</code> and <code>FILENAME</code>
	<dd>identify the directory path and file of interest. 
</dl>

Here are some sample URL's.
<dl>
   <dt>HTTP  (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
     	<dd><code>http://www.cc.ukans.edu/lynx_help/lynx_help_main.html</code>
   <dt>Gopher
     	<dd><code>gopher://gopher.micro.umn.edu/11/</code>
   <dt>FTP  (File Transfer Protocol)
     	<dd><code>ftp://ftp2.cc.ukans.edu/pub/lynx/README</code>
   <dt>WAIS  (Wide Area Information Service protocol)
     	<dd><code>wais://cnidr.org/directory-of-servers</code>
</dl>

  A URL may be specified to Lynx on the command line, as in:
<dl>
   <dd><code>lynx http://kufacts.cc.ukans.edu/cwis/start_kufacts.html</code>
</dl> 
<A HREF="#TOC">ToC</A>

<h2><A NAME="5">Starting Lynx with the the WWW_HOME environment variable.</A></h2>
You may also specify a starting file for Lynx using the WWW_HOME
environment variable,
<dl>
   <dt>UNIX
      <dl>
         <dt>ksh
       	   <dd><code>export WWW_HOME=http://info.cern.ch/default.html</code>
         <dt>csh
           <dd><code>setenv WWW_HOME http://info.cern.ch/default.html</code>
     </dl>
   <dt>VMS
      <dd><code>define "WWW_HOME" "http://info.cern.ch/default.html"</code>
</dl>  


<h2><A NAME="6">Navigating hypertext documents with Lynx</A></h2>

The process of moving within a hypertext web, selecting and displaying
links is known as "navigation." With Lynx almost all navigation can be
accomplished with the arrow keys and the numeric keypad. 
<pre>
                                       +-------+-------+-------+
                                       | TOP   |  /|\  | Page  |
              arrow keys               | of    |   |   | UP    |
                                       | text 7|   |  8|      9|
              +---------+              +-------+-------+-------+
              | SELECT  |              |       |       |       |
              | prev /|\|              | &lt;---  |       |  ---&gt; |
              | link  | |              |      4|      5|      6|
    +---------+---------+---------+    +-------+-------+-------+
    |    BACK | SELECT  | DISPLAY |    | END   |   |   | Page  |
    |&lt;-- prev | next  | | sel. --&gt;|    | of    |   |   | DOWN  |
    |    doc. | link \|/| link    |    | text 1|  \|/ 2|      3|
    +---------+---------+---------+    +-------+-------+-------+
</pre>

There are also a few other keyboard commands to aid in navigation.
Some of these commands depend on the fact that Lynx keeps a list of
each file you visit called the "history list".  The "backspace" or
"delete" key will show you the whole history list.  Any of the
documents shown in the list may be revisited by selecting them from
the history screen.  The 'm' key command will take you back to the
starting document.<p> 

The 'i' key presents an index of documents.  The default index is usually 
a document pointing to servers around the world, but the index can be 
changed by the system administrator or on the command line using the
<code>-index</code> switch, and therefore depends on how the Lynx
program you are using was configured. <p>

If you choose a link to a server with active access
authorization Lynx will automatically prompt for a
username and a password. If you give the correct information, you will
then be served the requested information. Lynx will automatically send
your username and password to the same server if it is needed
again. <A HREF="#TOC">ToC</A>

<h2><A NAME="7">Printing, Mailing, and Saving files to disk.</A></h2>
Documents may be printed using the 'p' command.  After pressing
the 'p' key a menu of Print Options will be displayed.  The menu
will vary according to several factors.  First, some sites set up
special accounts to let users run Lynx to access local information
systems.  Typically these accounts require no passwords and do not
require users to identify themselves.  As a result such accounts
are called "anonymous" accounts, and their users are considered
"anonymous" users.  In most configurations, all Lynx users
(including anonymous users) are able to mail files to themselves
and print the entire file to the screen.<p>
Additional print options are available for users who are using
Lynx from their own accounts (that is, so-called "non-anonymous
users").  In particular, the <code>"Save to a local file"</code>
option allows you to save the document into a file on your disk
space.  Any number of additional print options may also be
available as configured by your system administrator. <A HREF="#TOC">ToC</A>

<h2><A NAME="8">Lynx searching commands</A></h2>

Two commands activate searching in Lynx: "/" and "s".  While
viewing a normal document use the "/" command to find a word or
phrase within the current document.  The search type will depend
on the search option setting in the options menu (see below).  The
search options are case sensitive and case insensitive.  Some
documents are designated "index documents".  These documents can
be searched to retrieve additional information from an index
server.  The "s" key allows searching of index documents. <A HREF="#TOC">ToC</A>

<h2><A NAME="9">Lynx options menu</A></h2>
The Lynx Options Menu may be accessed by pressing the 'o' key. 
The current Lynx Options Menu contains the following configurable
options. 

<pre>
                      Options Menu

     E)ditor                    : emacs
     D)ISPLAY variable          : aixtest.cc.ukans.edu:0.0
     B)ookmark file             : home_page
     F)TP sort criteria         : By Filename
     P)ersonal mail address     : montulli@ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu
     S)earching type            : CASE INSENSITIVE
     C)haracter set             : ISO Latin 1
     V)I keys                   : OFF
     e(M)acs keys               : OFF
     K)eypad as arrows
          or Numbered links     : Numbers act as arrows
     U)ser mode                 : Advanced
     L)ocal execution links     : Always off
</pre>

An option can be changed by entering the capital letter of the option
you want to change (i.e.  'E' for Editor). For fields where text must
be entered, simply enter the text by typing on the keyboard.  The
Backspace and Delete keys can be used to correct mistakes, and CTRL-U
can be used to erase the whole line.  
When you are done entering a change press the Return key to get
back to the <code>Command?</code> prompt.<p>

For fields where you must choose from a list of choices, press any key
to toggle the choices and press the Return key to finish the change.<p>

When you are done changing options use the 'r' command to return
to Lynx or the '&gt;' command to save the options to a 
<code>.lynxrc</code> file and return to Lynx.<p>

The following table describes the options available on the Options
Menu:<p>

<dl>
   <dt>Editor
	<dd>The editor to be invoked when editing browsable files, and
	sending mail or comments.  The full pathname of the editor command
	should be specified when possible. 

   <dt>DISPLAY variable
	<dd>This option is only available on UNIX systems and is only relevant
	to X Window users.  The DISPLAY variable is picked up automatically
	from the environment if it has been previously set.

   <dt>Bookmark file
	<dd>This is the filename and location of your personal bookmark file.
	The bookmark file allows frequently travelled links to be stored in
	a personal easy to access file.  Using the 'a' command (see below)
	you may save any link into your bookmark file.  If the path specified
	does not begin with a slash then the path will reference your home
	directory.

   <dt>FTP sort criteria
	<dd>This option allows you to specify how files will be sorted within
	FTP listings.  The current options include 
	"<code>By Filename</code>", "<code>By Size</code>",
	"<code>By Type</code>", and "<code>By Date</code>".

   <dt>Personal mail address
	<dd>This mail address will be used to help you send files to yourself
	and will be included as the From: address in any mail or comments
	that you send.  It will also be sent as the From: field in all
	HTTP get requests.

   <dt>Searching type
	<dd>Searching type has two possible values: CASE INSENSITIVE
	(default) and CASE SENSITIVE.  The searching type effects
	inter-document searches only, and determines whether searches for
	words within documents will be done in a case-sensitive or
	case-insensitive manner. 

   <dt>VI keys
	<dd>If set to ON then the lowercase h,j,k, and l
	keys will be mapped to left, down, up, and right arrow, respectively.
	
   <dt>Emacs keys
	<dd>If set to ON then the CTRL-P, CTRL-N, CTRL-F, and CTRL-B
	keys will be mapped to up, down, right, and left arro arrow arroww, respectively.
	
   <dt>Keypad as arrows or numbered links
	<dd>This option gives the choice between navigating with the arrow keys
	or having every link numbered so that the
	links may be selected by numbers as well as using
	the arrow keys.

   <dt>User Mode
       <dd>There are three possible choices: Novice, Intermediate, and Advanced.
         <dl>
	    <dt>Novice
		<dd>In Novice mode two lines of help are displayed at the 
		    bottom of the screen.
	    <dt>Intermediate
		<dd>Intermediate mode turns off the help lines.
	    <dt>Advanced
		<dd>Advanced mode displays the URL of the currently selected
		link at the bottom of the screen.
         </dl>

   <dt>Local execution scripts or links
 	<dd>Local execution can be activated by the system administrator.
     	If it has not been activated you will not see this option
     	in the options menu.
      	When a local execution script is encountered Lynx 
        checks the users options to see whether the script can be
        executed. Users have the following options: 
          <dl>
	     <dt> Always off 
                 <dd>Local execution scripts will never be executed 
             <dt>For Local files only 
                 <dd>Local execution scripts will only be executed if the
                  script to be executed resides on the local machine, and
                  is referenced by a URL that begins with "file://localhost" 
             <dt>Always on 
                 <dd>    All local exection scripts will be executed 
          </dl>

   	<dd> If the users options permit the script to be executed Lynx will
     	spawn a shell and run the script. If the script cannot be
     	executed Lynx will show the script within the Lynx window and
     	inform the user that the script is not allowed to be executed
     	and will ask the user to check his/her options. <A HREF="#TOC">ToC</A>
</dl>

<h2><A NAME="10">Comments and mailto: links</A></h2>

At any time while viewing documents within Lynx, you may use the 'c'
command to send a mail message to the owner of the current document if
the author of the document has specified ownership.  If no ownership
is specified then comments are disabled.  Certain links called
"mailto:" links will also allow you to send mail to other people.
Using the mail features within Lynx is straightforward.  <p>

Once you have decided to send a comment or have selected a 
"mailto:" link a new screen will appear showing you who you are 
sending the message to. Lynx will ask for your name, your e-mail 
address, and the subject of the message.  If you have filled in the 
"personal mail address" field in the Options Menu, your e-mail address
will be filled in automatically.  After entering the above information, 
if you have an editor defined in the Options Menu and you are not an 
anonymous user then your specified editor will be spawned for you so 
that you can enter your message. If you do not have an editor 
defined or you are an anonymous user, a simple line mode input 
scheme will allow you to enter your message.<p>

To finish sending the message, exit your spawned editor or, if you are
using the simple line mode input scheme, type a "." (period) on a line
by itself.  You will be asked a final time whether to send the
message.  If you press 'y' then the message will be sent, if you press
'n' the message will be deleted. <A HREF="#TOC">ToC</A>

<h2><A NAME="18">USENET News posting</A></h2>

While reading <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/DataSources/News
/Groups/Overview.html">news</a> articles with Lynx you should 
see a link that says "Reply to user@host" and a link that says 
"Reply to newsgroup(s)"
    
<dl>
    <dt>Reply to user@host
        <dd>user@host will actually appear as the mail address of the
        person who posted the news article.  Selecting the link will
        allow you to send a message to the person who wrote the message
        you are currently viewing.  You will be given the option of
        including the original message in your reply.

    <dt>Reply to newsgroup(s)
        <dd>Selecting this link will allow you to post back to the
        newsgroup that you are currently reading and any newsgroups
        that the message may be cross-posted to.  You will be given
        the option of including the original message in your reply.
        Once you have typed in your message the <b>inews</b> program
        will be called to post your message to your news host. 
        <A HREF="#TOC">ToC</A>
</dl>

<h2><a name="19">Lynx and HTML Forms</a></h2>

This section describes the Lynx Forms Interface.  HTML gives document
providers the ability to create on-line forms which may be filled out
when the document is viewed. When a form is submitted the information
on the form can be used to search a database or complete a survey.
<p>

An HTML Form provides for the use of buttons or to perform an action
(such as <tt>submit</tt>), checkboxes and radio buttons to select
options from a list, and fields for entering text. <p> 
<dl>
<dt>Buttons:

<dd>Buttons are displayed in the same way that Lynx displays links in
a document. To "push" the button press the <b>RIGHT ARROW</B> or
<b>RETURN</b> key.
<p>
<dt>Checkboxes and Radio buttons

<dd>Checkboxes and radio buttons are displayed as parenthesis:
<tt>()</tt>. When a box is checked or a button selected, an asterisk
appears within the parenthesis: <tt>(*)</tt>. To check a box or select
a radio button press the <b>RIGHT ARROW</b> or <b>RETURN</b> key.
<p>
<dt> Text Entry Fields

<dd>Text entry fields are displayed as a row of underscores the length
of the entry field: <tt>_______</tt>. You may enter text directly by
typing at the keyboard. Use the <b>BACKSPACE</b> key to correct
errors. If you input more text than the field can hold your input will be 
truncated. If you fill a text field the cursor will not move off
the field but remain at the last field position.

</dl>

You can move around the form using the standard Lynx navigation keys.
<b>UP ARROW</b> and <b>DOWN ARROW</b> keys respectively select the
previous or next field, box, or button. The <b>TAB</b> key selects the
next field, box, or button.<p>

<b>NOTE:</b>If you have a text input field selected you will not have
access to any of the Lynx keystroke commands. Select a button or box
when you want to use Lynx keystrokes.<p>

<h2><A NAME="11">Viewing the HTML document source and editing documents</A></h2>

When viewing HTML documents it is possible to view the unrendered
(i.e., the original HTML) source of the document by pressing the '\'
(backslash) key.  The document will be reloaded from the server or
disk and displayed on the screen unrendered.  When viewing unrendered
documents you may print them as any normal document.<p>

Selecting the <b>Print to a local file</b> option from the Print Menu,
makes it possible to save the source of the document to disk so that
you may have a local copy of the document.<p>

NOTE: When saving an HTML document it is important to name the
document with a ".html" extension, if you want to read it with Lynx
again later.<p>

Lynx can allow users to edit documents that reside on the local
system.  To enable editing, documents must be referenced using a
"file:" URL or by specifying a plain filename on the command line as
in the following two examples:

<dl>
    <dd><code>lynx file://localhost/FULL/PATH/FILENAME</code>
    <dd><code>lynx path/filename.html</code>
</dl>

In addition, the user must also specify an editor in the Options Menu
so that Lynx knows which editor to use.  If the file is specified
correctly and an editor is defined, then you may edit documents by
using the 'e' command.  When the 'e' command is entered your specified
editor is spawned to edit the file.  After changes are completed, exit
your editor and you will return to Lynx.  Lynx will reload and render
the file so that changes can be immediately examined. <A HREF="#TOC">ToC</A>

<h2><A NAME="12">Reloading files and refreshing the display</A></h2>

The CTRL-R command will reload and rerender the file that you are
currently viewing.  CTRL-L or CTRL-W will refresh or wipe the screen to remove
or correct any errors that may be caused by operating system or other
messages. <A HREF="#TOC">ToC</A>

<h2><A NAME="13">Lynx bookmarks</A></h2>
It is often useful to place a bookmark to aid in returning quickly to
a document.  To use the bookmark feature you must first use the Options 
Menu to specify a bookmark filename. <p>

To save a bookmark to the document you wish to place in the
bookmark file press the 'a' key and you will be asked
<dl>
	<dd><code>Save D)ocument or L)ink to bookmark 
	file or C)ancel? (d,l,c):</code>
</dl>

Answer 'd' to save a link to the document you are currently
viewing or 'l' to save the link that is currently selected on the
page.  Selecting 'c' will cancel without saveing anything to your
bookmark file.<p>

Use the 'v' command to view the list of bookmarks you have saved.
While viewing the bookmark list you may select a bookmark as you would
any other link. <A HREF="#TOC">ToC</A>

<h2><A NAME="14">Other useful commands</A></h2>
<dl>
   <dt><b>!</b>
  	<dd>When '!' is pressed your default shell will be
  	spawned.  When you quit or exit the shell you will return to Lynx. 
  	(Usually 'exit' under UNIX and 'logout' under VMS) This command is
  	usually disabled for anonymous users. 
   <dt><b>g</b>
  	<dd>The 'g' command allows any URL to be viewed.  Pressing
  	the 'g' command will bring up a prompt asking for a URL.
  	Type in the URL that you wish to view.
   <dt><b>=</b>
  	<dd>The '=' command shows information about the current document
  	and the currently selected link if there is one.  The number of
  	lines in the file, URL, title, owner, and type are shown.
   <dt><b>z</b>
	<dd>Lynx supports completely interruptable I/O processes. Press the 'z'
    	key at any time during a connect or transfer process and the process 
    	will be halted. If any data was transferred before the interrupt, 
    	it will be displayed. <A HREF="#TOC">ToC</A>
</dl>

<h2><A NAME="15">The Lynx command</A></h2>
The basic syntax of the Lynx command can be represented as one of
the following:

<dl>

<h2><A NAME="16">Lynx development history</A></h2>
Lynx grew out of efforts to build a campus-wide information system
at The University of Kansas.  The earliest versions of Lynx
provided a user-friendly, distributed hypertext interface for
users connected to multiuser (UN*X and VMS) systems via
curses-oriented display devices.  A custom hypertext format was
developed to support hypertext links to local files and files on
remote Gopher servers.  Using Gopher servers for distributed file
service allowed information providers to publish information from
a wide variety of platforms (including UN*X, VMS, VM/CMS and
Macintosh).  In addition, Lynx became the most user-friendly
Gopher client, although that was only an ancillary capability.<p>
This distributed approach let providers retain complete control
over their information, but it made communication between users
and providers somewhat more difficult.  Following the lead of Neal
Erdwien, of Kansas State University, the Lynx hypertext format was
extended to include links for including ownership information with
each file.  This information made it possible for users running
Lynx clients to send comments and suggestions via e-mail to the
providers.<p>

This early version of Lynx was also augmented to support hypertext
links to programs running on remote systems.  It included the
ability to open a Telnet connection, as well as the ability to
start programs via rexec, inetd, or by direct socket connects. 
These capabilities were included to allow users to access
databases or custom program interfaces.<p>

A subsequent version of Lynx incorporated the World Wide Web
libraries to allow access to the full list of WWW servers, along
with the option to build hypertext documents in HTML, rather than
the native Lynx format.  HTML has become far more widely used, and
the native format is being phased out.  With the addition of the
WWW libraries, Lynx became a fully-featured WWW client, limited
only by the display capabilites offered in the curses
environment.<p>

At The University of Kansas, Lynx is used in several different
ways to give users access to the campus wide information system. 
First, it is run on several local clients from a script named
"kufacts" that points to the starting file located on a local
server.  Second, it runs whenever a user logs into an account
called "kufacts" on a system named kufacts.cc.ukans.edu.  Users
without a local account may use this system to explore the KU CWIS
and experiment with Lynx.<p>

Lynx was designed by Lou Montulli, Charles Rezac and Michael Grobe
of Academic Computing Services at The University of Kansas.  Lynx
was implemented by Lou Montulli and is now maintained by Garrett Arch
Blythe.<p>

Lynx has incorporated code from a variety of sources along the
way.  The earliest versions of Lynx included code from Earl Fogel
of Computing Services at the University of Saskatchewan, who
implemented HYPERREZ in the UN*X environment.  Those versions also
incorporated libraries from the UN*X Gopher clients developed at
the University of Minnesota, and the later versions of Lynx rely
on the WWW client library code developed by Tim Berners-Lee (and
others) and the WWW community.<p>
