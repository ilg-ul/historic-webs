The above text was one of the first web pages (if not the first) hosted on a server located in Romania, available most probably as <strong>http://www.Romania.EU.net</strong>.
<p>
A few days later, on the <strong>24th of August 1994</strong> it was replaced with a full <a href="/info.old/">info page</a>, with content from an existing BBS, already available for dial-up users.
<p>
On the <strong>1st of December 1994</strong> the page was restructured to a shorter <a href="/info/">home page</a>.
<p>
Please note that from the very beginning, this site also provided non-techical content, for example the beautiful text of <a href="/alice/alice.html">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a>.
<p>
Enjoy,
<p>
