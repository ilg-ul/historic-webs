CompuServe is now offering Internet access to the CompuServe Information
Service via the telnet protocol.  To access the CompuServe Information
Service, simply telnet to "CompuServe.com".  If you intend to perform
binary file transfers, disable your escape character.<P>
Once connected to CompuServe, enter a host name of CIS.  You will then
have the opportunity to log into the CompuServe Information Service,
obtain additional help, or end your session.  Non-CompuServe members may
access the "Obtaining a CompuServe Information Service Membership" help
option to learn how to get a CompuServe user id and password.  All help
files will be sent to your electronic mail address so that you may browse
them at your leisure.<P>
If you choose to logon, you will then be connected to the CompuServe
Information Service and the User ID: prompt will be displayed.  Enter
your CompuServe User ID and logon as usual. There is no surcharge for
using the Internet to connect to CompuServe.  Normal rates apply for
CompuServe Information Service Access.<P>
