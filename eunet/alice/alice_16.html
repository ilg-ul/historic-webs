<PRE>
<I>CHILD of the pure unclouded brow
And dreaming eyes of wonder!
Though time be fleet, and I and thou
Are half a life asunder,
Thy loving smile will surely hail
The love-gift of a fairy-tale.</I>

<I>I have not seen thy sunny face,
Nor heard thy silver laughter,
No thought of me shall find a place
In thy young life's hereafter ---
Enough that now thou wilt not fail
To listen to my fairy-tale.</I>

<I>A tale begun in other days,
When summer suns were glowing ---
A simple chime, that served to time
The rythm of out rowing ---
Whose echoes live in memory yet,
Though envious years would say `forget'.</I>

<I>Come, hearken then, ere voice of dread,
With bitter tidings laden,
Shall summon to unwelcome bed
A melancholy maiden!
We are but older children, dear,
Who fret to find our bedtime near.</I>

<I>Without, the frost, the blinding snow,
The strom-wind's moody madness ---
Within, the firelight's ruddy glow
And childhood's nest of gladness.
The magic words shall hold thee fast:
Thou shalt not heed the raving blast.</I>

<I>And though the shadow of a sigh
May tremble through the story,
For `happy summer days' gone by,
And vanish'd summer glory ---
It shall not touch with breath of bale
The pleasance of our fairy-tale.</I>
</PRE>
