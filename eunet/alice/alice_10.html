A Mad Tea-Party</A></H1>
<P>
THERE was a table set out under a tree in front
of the house, and the March Hare and the
Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting
between them, fast asleep, and the other two were
resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head.
"Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse," thought
Alice; "only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't
mind."
<P>
The table was a large one, but the three were all
crowded together at one corner of it.  "No room!
No room!" they cried out when they saw Alice
coming.  "There's <EM>plenty</EM> of room!" said Alice
indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair
at one end of the table.
<P>
"Have some wine," the March Hare said in an
encouraging tone.
<P>
Alice looked all round the table, but there was
nothing on it but tea.  "I don't see any wine," she
remarked.
<P>
"There isn't any," said the March Hare.
<P>
"Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it," said
Alice angrily.
<P>
"It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without
being invited," said the March Hare.
<P>
"I didn't know it was <EM>your</EM> table," said Alice;
"it's laid for a great many more than three."
<P>
"Your hair wants cutting," said the Hatter.  He
had been looking at Alice for some time with great
curiosity, and this was his first speech.
<P>
"You shouldn't make personal remarks," Alice
said with some severity; "it's very rude."
<P>
The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing
this; but all he <EM>said</EM> was, "Why is a raven like a
writing-desk?"
<P>
"Come we shall have some fun now!" thought
Alice.  "I'm glad they've begun asking riddles.  I
believe I can guess that," she added aloud.
<P>
"Do you mean that you think you can find out
the answer to it?" said the March Hare.
<P>
"Exactly so," said Alice.
<P>
"Then you should say what you mean," the
March Hare went on.
<P>
"I do," Alice hastily replied; "at least--at least I
mean what I say--that's the same thing, you
know."
<P>
"Not the same thing a bit!" said the Hatter,
"Why, you might just as well say that 'I see what I eat' is
the same thing as 'I eat what I see'!"
<P>
"You might just as well say," added the March
Hare, "that 'I like what I get' is the same thing as
'I get what I like'!"
<P>
"You might just as well say," added the Dormouse who
seemed to be talking in his sleep "that
'I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing as 'I sleep
when I breathe'!"
<P>
"It <EM>is</EM> the same thing with you," said the Hatter,
and here the conversation dropped, and the party
sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all
she could remember about ravens and
writing-desks, which wasn't much.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/alice24.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
The Hatter was the first to break the silence,
"What day of the month is it?" he said, turning to
Alice: he had taken his watch out of his pocket,
and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now
and then, and holding it to his ear.
<P>
Alice considered a little, and then said, "The
fourth."
<P>
"Two days wrong!" sighed the Hatter.  "I told
you butter wouldn't suit the works!" he added,
looking angrily at the March Hare.
<P>
"It was the <EM>best</EM> butter," the March Hare meekly
replied.
<P>
"Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,"
the Hatter grumbled: "you shouldn't have put it in
with the bread-knife."
<P>
The March Hare took the watch and looked at it
gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and
looked at it again: but he could think of nothing
better to say than his first remark, "It was the <EM>best</EM>
butter, you know."
<P>
Alice had been looking over his shoulder with
some curiosity.  "What a funny watch!" she
remarked.  "It tells the day of the month, and doesn't
tell what o'clock it is!"
<P>
"Why should it?" muttered the Hatter.  "Does
<EM>your</EM> watch tell you what year it is?"
<P>
"Of course not," Alice replied very readily: "but
that's because it stays the same year for such a long
time together."
<P>
"Which is just the case with <EM>mine,</EM>" said the Hatter.
<P>
Alice felt dreadfully puzzled.  The Hatter's
remark seemed to have no meaning in it, and yet it
was certainly English.  "I don't quite understand,"
she said, as politely as she could.
<P>
"The Dormouse is asleep again," said the Hatter,
and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose.
<P>
The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and
said without opening its eyes, "Of course, of course;
just what I was going to remark myself."
<P>
"Have you guessed the riddle yet?" the Hatter
said, turning to Alice again.
<P>
"No, I give it up," Alice replied: "what's the
answer?"
<P>
"I haven't the slightest idea," said the Hatter.
<P>
"Nor I," said the March Hare.
<P>
Alice sighed wearily.  "I think you might do
something better with the time," she said, "than
waste it asking riddles with no answers."
<P>
"If you knew Time as well as I do," said the
Hatter, "you wouldn't talk about wasting <EM>it.</EM> It's
<EM>him.</EM>"
<P>
"I don't know what you mean," said Alice.
<P>
"Of course you don't!" the Hatter said, tossing
his bead contemptuously.  "I daresay you never
even spoke to Time!"
<P>
"Pernaps not," Alice cautiously replied: "but I
know I have to beat time when I learn music."
<P>
"Ah!  that accounts for it," said the Hatter.  "He
won't stand beating.  Now, if you only keep on
good terms with him, he'd do almost anything you
liked with the clock.  For instance, suppose it were
nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin
lessons: you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time,
and round goes the clock in a twinkling!  Half-past
one, time for dinner!"
<P>
("I only wish it was," the March Hare said to
itself in a whisper.)
<P>
"That would be grand, certainly," said Alice
thoughtfully: "but then--I shouldn't be hungry
for it, you know."
<P>
"Not at first, perhaps," said the Hatter: "but you
could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked."
<P>
"Is that the way <EM>you</EM> manage?"  Alice asked.
<P>
The Hatter shook his head mournfully.  "Not
I!" he replied.  "We quarrelled last March--just
before <EM>he</EM> went mad, you know--" (pointing with
his teaspoon at the March Hare) "--it was at the
great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I
had to sing
<P>
<PRE>
<EM>"Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!</EM>
<EM>how I wonder what you're at!</EM>
</PRE>
<P>
You know the song, perhaps?"
<P>
"It goes on, you know," the Hatter continued, "in this way:---
<P>
<PRE>
<EM>Up above the world you fly,</EM>
<EM>Like a tea-tray in the sky.</EM>
<EM>Twinkle, twinkle</EM>---"
</PRE>
<P>
Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began
singing in its sleep, "<EM>Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle twinkle</EM>---"
and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop.
<P>
"Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse," said
the Hatter, "when the Queen jumped up and bawled
out, "He's murdering the time!  Off with his
head!"
<P>
"How dreadfully savage!" exclaimed Alice.
<P>
"And ever since that," the Hatter went on in a
mournful tone, "he won't do a thing I ask!  It's
always six o'clock now."
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/alice25.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
A bright idea came into Alice's head.  "Is that
the reason so many tea-things are put out here?"
she asked.
<P>
"Yes, that's it," said the Hatter with a sigh: "it's
always tea-time, and we've no time to wash the
things between whiles."
<P>
"Then you keep moving round, I suppose?" said
Allce.
<P>
"Exactly so," said the Hatter: "as the things get
used up."
<P>
"But what happens when you come to the
beginning again?"  Alice ventured to ask.
<P>
"Suppose we change the subject," the March
Hare interrupted, yawning.  "I'm getting tired of
this.  I vote the young lady tells us a story."
<P>
"I'm afraid I don't know one," said Alice, rather
alarmed at the proposal.
<P>
"Then the Dormouse shall!" they both cried.
"Wake up, Dormouse!"  And they pinched it on
both sides at once.
<P>
The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes.  "I wasn't
asleep," he said in a hoarse, feeble voice: "I heard
every word you fellows were saying."
<P>
"Tell us a story!" said the March Hare.
<P>
"Yes, please do!" pleaded Alice.
<P>
"And be quick about it," added the Hatter, "or
you'll be asleep again before it's done."
<P>
"Once upon a time there were three little sisters,"
the Dormouse began in a great hurry; "and their
names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived
at the bottom of a well---"
<P>
"What did they live on?" said Alice, who always
took a great interest in questions of eating and
drinking.
<P>
"They lived on treacle," said the Dormouse, after
thinking a minute or two.
<P>
"They couldn't have done that, you know,"
Alice gently remarked; "they'd have been ill."
<P>
"So they were," said the Dormouse; "<EM>very</EM>
ill."
<P>
Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an
extraordinary way of living would be like, but it
puzzled her too much, so she went on: "But why
did they live at the bottom of a well?"
<P>
"Take some more tea," the March Hare said to
Alice, very earnestly.
<P>
"I've had nothing yet," Alice replied in an
offended tone, "so I can't take more."
<P>
"You mean you can't take <EM>less,</EM>" said the Hatter:
"it's very easy to take <EM>more</EM> than nothing."
<P>
"Nobody asked <EM>your</EM> opinion," said Alice.
<P>
"Who's making personal remarks now?" the
Hatter asked triumphantly.
<P>
Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so
he helped herself to some tea and breadandbutter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and
repeated her question.  "Why did they live at the
bottom of a well?"
<P>
The Dormouse again took a minute or two to
think about it, and then said, "It was a treacle-well."
<P>
"There's no such thing!"  Alice was beginning
very angrily, but the Hatter and the March Hare
went "Sh sh!" and the Dormouse sulkily remarked.
"If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story
or yourself."
<P>
"No, please go on!"  Alice said.  "I won't
interrupt again.  I daresay there may be <EM>one.</EM>"
<P>
"One indeed!" said the Dormouse indignantly.
However, he consented to go on.  "And so these
three little sisters--they were learning to draw, you
know---"
<P>
"What did they draw?" said Alice, quite
forgetting her promise.
<P>
"Treacle," said the Dormouse, without
considering at all this time.
"I want a clean cup," interrupted the Hatter:
"let's all move one place on."
<P>
He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse
followed him: the March Hare moved into the
Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly
took the place of the March Hare.  The Hatter
was the only one who got any advantage from the
change: and Alice was a good deal worse off, as the
March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his
plate.
<P>
Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again,
so she began very cautiously: "But I don't
understand.  Where did they draw the treacle from?"
<P>
"You can draw water out of a water-well," said
the Hatter; "so I should think you could draw
treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?"
<P>
"But they were <EM>in</EM> the well," Alice said to the D
ormouse, not choosing to notice this last remark.
<P>
"Of course they were," said the Dormouse; "well
in."
<P>
This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let
the Dormouse go on for some time without
interrupting it.
<P>
"They were learning to draw," the Dormouse
went on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it was
getting very sleepy; "and they drew all manner of
things-everything that begins with an M---"
<P>
"Why with an M?" said Alice.
<P>
"Why not?" said the March Hare.
<P>
Alice was silent.
<P>
The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time,
and was going off into a doze; but, on being
pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a
little shriek, and went on: "--that begins with an
M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and
memory, and muchness--you know you say things
are "much of a muchness'--did you ever see such a
thing as a drawing of a muchness?"
<P>
"Really, now you ask me," said Alice, very much
confused, "I don't think---"
<P>
"Then you shouldn't talk," said the Hatter.
<P>
This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could
bear: she got up in great disgust, and walked off;
the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of
the others took the least notice of her going, though
she looked back once or twice, half hoping that
they would call after her: the last time she saw them,
they were trying to put the Dormouse into the
teapot.
<P>
"At any rate I'll never go <EM>there</EM> again!" said
Alice as she picked her way through the wood.
"It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my
life!"
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/alice26.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the
trees had a door leading right into it.  "That's very
curious!" she thought.  "But everything's curious
to-day.  I think I may as well go in at once."  And
in she went.
<P>
Once more she found herself in the long hall, and
close to the little glass table.  "Now, I'll manage
better this time," she said to herself, and began by
taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door
that led into the garden.  Then she set to work
nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of
it in her pocket) tlll she was about a foot high:
then she walked down the little passage: and <EM>then--</EM>
she found herself at last in the beautiful garden,
among the bright flower-beds and the cool
fountains.
