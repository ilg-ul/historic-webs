Humpty Dumpty</A></H1>
<P>
HOWEVER, the egg only got larger and larger,
and more and more human: when she had
come within a few yards of it, she saw that it had
eyes and a nose and mouth; and when she had come
close to it, she saw clearly that it was HUMPTY
DUMPTY himself.  "It can't be anybody else!
she said to herself.  "I'm as certain of it, as if his
name was written all over his face!"
<P>
It might have been written a hundred times,
easily, on that enormous face.  Humpty Dumpty
was sitting with his legs crossed, like a Turk, on the
top of a high wall--such a narrow one that Alice
quite wondered how he could keep his balanceand, as his
eyes were steadily fixed in the opposite
direction, and he didn't take the least notice of her,
she thought he must be a stuffed figure.
<P>
"And how exactly like an egg he is!" she said
aloud, standing with her hands ready to catch him,
for she was every moment expecting him to fall.
<P>
"It's <EM>very</EM> provoking," Humpty Dumpty said after
a long silence, looking away from Alice as he spoke,
"to be called an egg--<EM>very</EM>!"
<P>
"I said you <EM>looked</EM> like an egg, Sir," Alice gently
explained.  "And some eggs are very pretty, you
know," she added, hoping to turn her remark into
a sort of compliment.
<P>
"Some people," said Humpty Dumpty, looking
away from her as usual, "have no more sense than
a baby!"
<P>
Alice didn't know what to say to this: it wasn't at
all like conversation, she thought, as he never said
anything to <EM>her;</EM> in fact, his last remark was
evidently addressed to a tree--so she stood and softly
repeated to herself:---
<P>
<PRE>
<EM>Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall:
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put Humpty Dumpty in his place again.</EM>
</PRE>
<P>
"That last line is much too long for the poetry,"
she added, almost out loud, forgetting that Humpty
Dumpty would hear her.
<P>
"Don't stand chattering to yourself like that,"
Humpty Dumpty said, looking at her for the first
time, "but tell me your name and your business."
<P>
"My <EM>name</EM> is Alice, but---"
<P>
"It's a stupid name enough!"  Humpty Dumpty
interrupted impatiently.  "What does it mean?"
<P>
"<EM>Must a</EM> name mean something?"  Alice asked
doubtfully.
<P>
"Of course it must," Humpty Dumpty said with
a short laugh: <EM>my</EM> name means the shape I am
and a good handsome shape it is, too.  With a name
like yours, you might be any shape, almost."
<P>
"Why do you sit out here all alone?" said"Alice,
not wishing to begin an argument.
<P>
"Why, because there's nobody with me!" cried
Humpty Dumpty.  "Did you think I didn't know
the answer to <EM>that</EM>? Ask another."
<P>
"Don't you think you'd be safer down on the
ground?"  Alice went on, not with any idea of
making another riddle, but simply in her good-natured
anxiety for the queer creature.  "That wall is so
<EM>very</EM> narrow!"
<P>
"What tremendously easy riddles you ask!"
Humpty Dumpty growled out.  "Of course I don't
think so!  Why, if ever I <EM>did</EM> fall off--which there's
no chance of--but if did---" Here he pursed up
his lips, and looked so solemn and grand that Alice
could hardly help laughing.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/glass26.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
"If I did fall," he went
on, <EM>the King has promised me--</EM>ah, you may turn
pale, if you like!  You didn't think I was going to
say that, did you?  <EM>The king has promised me--with
his own mouth</EM>--to--to---"
<P>
"To send all his horses and all his men," Alice
interrupted, rather unwisely.
<P>
"Now I declare that's too bad!"  Humpty
Dumpty cried, breaking into a sudden passion.
"You've been listening at doors--and behind trees
<P>
"I haven't, indeed!"  Alice said very gently.  "It's
in a book."
<P>
"Ah well!  They may write such things in a
<EM>book,</EM>" Humpty Dumpty said in a calmer tone.
"That's what you call a History of England, that is
Now, take a good look at me!  I'm one that has
spoken to a King, I am: mayhap you'll never see
such another: and to show you I'm not proud, you
may shake hands with me!"  And he grinned
almost from ear to ear, as he leant forwards (and as
nearly as possible fell off the wall in doing so) and
offered Alice his hand.  She watched him a little
anxiously as she took it.  "If he smiled much more,
the ends of his mouth might meet behind," she
thought: "and then I don't know what would
happen to his head!  I'm afraid it would come
off!"
<P>
"Yes, all his horses and all his men," Humpty
Dumpty went on.  "They'd pick me up again in a
minute, <EM>they</EM> would!  However, this conversation is
going on a little too fast: let's go back to the last
remark but one."
<P>
"I'm afraid I can't quite remember it," Alice said
very politely.
<P>
"In that case we may start afresh," said Humpty
Dumpty, "and it's my turn to choose a
subject---" ("He talks about it just as if it was a
game!" thought Alice.) "So here's a question for
you.  How old did you say you were?
<P>
Alice made a short calculation, and said, "Seven
years and six months.'
<P>
"Wrong!"  Humpty Dumpty exclaimed
triumphantly.  "You never said a word like it."
<P>
"I thought you meant "How old <EM>are</EM> you?' " Alice
explained.
<P>
"If I'd meant that, I'd have said it," said Humpty
Dumpty.
<P>
Alice didn't want to begin another argument, so
she said nothing.
<P>
"Seven years and six months!"  Humpty Dumpty
repeated thoughtfully.  "An uncomfortable sort of
age.  Now if you'd asked <EM>my</EM> advice, I'd have said,
"Leave off at seven--but it's too late now."
<P>
"I never ask advice about growing," Alice said
indignantly.
<P>
"Too proud?" the other enquired.
<P>
Alice felt even more indignant at this suggestion.
"I mean," she said, "that one can't help growing
older."
<P>
"<EM>One</EM> can't, perhaps," said Humpty Dumpty,
"but <EM>two</EM> can.  With proper assistance, you might
have left off at seven."
<P>
"What a beautiful belt you've got on!"  Alice
suddenly remarked. (They had had quite enough of
the subject of age, she thought: and if they were
really to take turns in choosing subjects, it was her
turn now).  "At least," she corrected herself on
second thoughts, "a beautiful cravat, I should have
said--no, a belt, I mean--oh, I <EM>beg</EM> your pardon!"
she added in dismay, for Humpty Dumpty looked
thoroughly offended, and she began to wish she
hadn't chosen that subject.  "If only I knew," she
thought to herself, "which was neck and which was
waist!"
<P>
Evidently Humpty Dumpty was very angry,
though he said nothing for a minute or two.  When
he <EM>did</EM> speak again, it was in a deep growl.
<P>
"It is a--<EM>most--provoking--</EM>thing," he said at
last, "when a person doesn't know a cravat from a
belt!"
<P>
"I know it's very ignorant of me," Alice replied
in so humble a tone that Humpty Dumpty relented.
<P>
"It's a cravat, child, and a beautiful one, as you
say.  It's a present from the White King and Queen.
There now!"
<P>
"Is it really?" said Alice, quite pleased to find she
had chosen a good subject, after all.
<P>
"They gave it me," Humpty Dumpty continued
thoughtfully, as he crossed one knee over the other
and clasped his hands round it, "--for an un-birthday present."
<P>
"I beg your pardon?"  Alice said with a puzzled
air.
<P>
"I'm not offended," said Humpty Dumpty.
<P>
"I mean, what <EM>is</EM> an un-birthday present?"
<P>
"A present given when it isn't your birthday, of
course.
<P>
Alice considered a little.  "I like birthday presents
best," she said at last.
<P>
"You don't know what you're talking about!"
cried Humpty Dumpty.  "How many days are there
in a year?"
<P>
"Three hundred and sixty-five," said Alice.
<P>
"And how many birthdays have you?"
<P>
"One."
<P>
"And if you take one from three hundred and
sixty-five, what remains ?"
<P>
"Three hundred and sixty-four, of course."
<P>
Humpty Dumpty looked doubtfuly.  "I'd rather
see that done on paper," he said.
<P>
Alice couldn't help smiling as she took out her
memorandum-book, and worked the sum for him:
<P>
<PRE>
365
---
  1
---
364
</PRE>
<P>
Humpty Dumpty took the book, and looked at it
very carefully.  "That <EM>seems</EM> to be done right---"
he began.
<P>
"You're holding it upside down!"  Alice
interrupted.
<P>
"To be sure I was!"  Humpty Dumpty said gaily,
as she turned it round for him.  "I thought it looked
a little queer.  As I was saying, that <EM>seems</EM> to be done
right--though I haven't time to look it over
thoroughly just now--and that shows that there are
three hundred and sixty-four days when you get
un-birthday presents---"
<P>
"Certainly," said Alice.
<P>
"And only <EM>one</EM> for birthday presents, you know,
There's glory for you!"
<P>
"I don't know what you mean by `glory,' " Alice
said.
<P>
Humpty Dumpty smiled contemptuously.  "Of
course you don't--till I tell you.  I meant "there's a
nice knock-down argument for you!"
<P>
"But `glory' doesn't mean "a nice knock-down
argument," Alice objected.
<P>
"When <EM>I</EM> use a word," Humpty Dumpty said in
a rather a scornful tone, "it means just what I choose
it to mean--neither more nor less.
<P>
"The question is," said Alice, "whether you <EM>can</EM>
make words mean different things."
<P>
"The question is," said Humpty Dumpty, "which
is to be master--that's all."
<P>
Alice was too much puzzled to say anything, so
after a minute Humpty Dumpty began again.
"They've a temper, some of them--particularly
verbs, they're the proudest--adjectives you can do
anything with, but not verbs--however, I can
manage the whole lot!  Impenetrability!  That's
what I say!"
<P>
"Would you tell me, please," said Alice, "what
that means ?"
<P>
"Now you talk like a reasonable child," said
Humpty Dumpty, looking very much pleased.  "I
meant by "impenetrability' that we've had enough
of that subject, and it would be just as well if you'd
mention what you meant to do next, as I suppose
you don't intend to stop here all the rest of your
life."
<P>
"That's a great deal to make one word mean,"
Alice said in a thoughtful tone.
<P>
"When I make a word do a lot of work like that,"
said Humpty Dumpty, "I always pay it extra."
<P>
"Oh!" said Alice.  She was too much puzzled to
make any other remark.
<P>
"Ah, you should see 'em come round me of a
Saturday night," Humpty Dumpty went on,
wagging his head gravely from side to side: "for to get
their wages, you know."
<P>
(Alice didn't venture to ask what he paid them
with; and so you see I can't tell <EM>you</EM>.)
<P>
"You seem very clever at explaining words, Sir,"
"said Alice.  "Would you kindly tell me the meaning
of the poem called `Jabberwocky'?"
<P>
"Let's hear it," said Humpty Dumpty.  "I can
explain all the poems that ever were invented--and
a good many that haven't been invented just yet.'
<P>
This sounded very hopeful, so Alice repeated the
first verse:---
<P>
<PRE>
<EM>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.</EM>
</PRE>
<P>
"That's enough to begin with," Humpty Dumpty
interrupted: "there are plenty of hard words there,
<EM>`Brillig'</EM> means four o'clock in the afternoon--the
time when you begin <EM>broiling</EM> things for dinner."
<P>
"That'll do very well," said Alice: "and <EM>`slithy'</EM>?"
<P>
"Well, <EM>`slithy'</EM> means `lithe and slimy.' `Lithe' is
the same as `active.' You see it's like a
portmanteau--there are two meanings packed up into one
word."
<P>
"I see it now," Alice remarked thoughtfully:
"and what are <EM>toves</EM>?
<P>
"Well, <EM>`toves'</EM> are something like badgers
they're something like lizards--and they're
something like corkscrews."
<P>
"They must be very curious-looking creatures."
<P>
"They are that," said Humpty Dumpty: "also
they make their nests under sun-dials--also they
live on cheese."
<P>
"And what's to <EM>`gyre'</EM> and to <EM>`gymble'</EM>?"
<P>
"To <EM>`gyre'</EM> is to go round and round like a
gyroscope.  To <EM>`gimble'</EM> is to make holes like a gimlet."
<P>
"And <EM>`the wabe'</EM> is the grass plot round a
sundial, I suppose?" said Alice, surprised at her own
ingenuity.
<P>
"Of course it is.  It's called <EM>`wabe,'</EM> you know
because it goes a long way before it, and a long way
behind it---"
<P>
"And a long way beyond it on each side," Alice
added.
<P>
"Exactly so.  Well, the <EM>`mimsy'</EM> is `flimsy and
miserable' (there's another portmanteau for you).
And a <EM>`borogove'</EM> is a thin shabby-looking bird with
its feathers sticking out all round--something like
a live mop."
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/glass27.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
"And then <EM>`mome raths'</EM>?" said Alice.  "If I'm not
giving you too much trouble."
<P>
"Well, a <EM>`rath'</EM> is a sort of green pig: but <EM>"mome'</EM>
I'm not certain about.  I think it's short for "from
home'--meaning that they'd lost their way, you
<P>
"And what does <EM>`outgrabe'</EM> mean?"
<P>
"Well, <EM>`outgribing'</EM> is something between
bellowing and whistling, with a kind of sneeze in the
middle: however, you'll hear it done, maybe--down
in the wood yonder--and when you've once heard
it you'll be <EM>quite</EM> content.  Who's been repeating all
that hard stuff to you?"
<P>
"I read it in a book," said Alice.  "But I had some
poetry repeated to me, much easier than that, byTweedledee, I think."
<P>
"As to poetry, you know," said Humpty
Dumpty, stretching out one of his great hands, <EM>"I</EM>
can repeat poetry as well as other folk if it comes to
that---"
<P>
"Oh, it needn't come to that!"  Alice hastily said,
<P>
"The piece I'm going to repeat," he went on
without noticing her remark, "was written entirely
for your amusement."
<P>
Alice felt that in that case she really <EM>ought</EM> to
listen to it, so she sat down, and said "Thank you"
rather sadly.
<P>
<PRE>
<EM>In winter when the fields are white,
I sing this song for your delight---</EM>
</PRE>
<P>
only I don't sing it," he added, as an explaination.
<P>
"I see you don't," said Alice.
<P>
"If you can <EM>see</EM> whether I'm singing or not, you've
sharper eyes than most," Humpty Dumpty
remarked severely.  Alice was silent.
<P>
<PRE>
<EM>In spring, when woods are getting green,
I'll try and tell you what I'mean.</EM>
</PRE>
<P>
"Thank you very much," said Alice.
<P>
<PRE>
<EM>In summer, when the days are long,
Perhaps you'll understand the song:</EM>

<EM>In autumn, when the leaves are brown
Take pen and ink and write it down.</EM>
</PRE>
<P>
"I will, if I can remember it so long," said Alice.
<P>
"You needn't go on making remarks like that,"
Humpty Dumpty said: "they're not sensible, and
they put me out."
<P>
<PRE>
<EM>I sent a message to the fish:
I told them `This is what I wish.'</EM>

<EM>The little fishes of the sea,
They sent an answer back to me.</EM>

<EM>The little fishes' answer was
`We cannot do it, Sir, because---'</EM>
</PRE>
<P>
"I'm afraid I don't quite understand," said Alice.
<P>
"It gets easier further on," Humpty Dumpty
replied.
<P>
<PRE>
<EM>I sent to them again to say
`It will be better to obey.'</EM>

<EM>The fishes answered with a grin,
`Why, what a temper you are in!'</EM>

<EM>I told them once, I told them twice:
They would not listen to advice.</EM>

<EM>I took a kettle large and new,
Fit for the deed I had to do.</EM>

<EM>My heart went hop, my heart went thump;
I filled the kettle at the pump.</EM>

<EM>Then some one came to me and said,
`The little fishes are in bed.'</EM>

<EM>I said to him, I said it plain,
`Then you must wake them up again.'</EM>

<EM>I said it very loud and clear;
I went and shouted in his ear.</EM>
</PRE>
<P>
Humpty Dumpty raised his voice almost to a
scream as he repeated this verse, and Alice thought
with a shudder, "I wouldn't have been the
messenger for <EM>anything</EM>!"
<P>
<PRE>
<EM>But he was very stiff and proud;
He said `You needn't shout so loud!'</EM>

<EM>And he was very proud and stiff;
He said, `I'd go and wake them, if---'</EM>

<EM>I took a corkscrew from the shelf.
I went to wake them up myself.</EM>

<EM>And when I found the door was locked
I pulled and pushed and kicked and knocked.</EM>

<EM>And when I found the door was shut,
I tried to turn the handle, but---</EM>
</PRE>
<P>
There was a long pause.
<P>
"Is that all?"  Alice timidly asked.
<P>
"That's all," said Humpty Dumpty.  "Good-bye."
<P>
This was rather sudden, Alice thought: but, after
such a <EM>very</EM> strong hint that she ought to be going,
she felt that it would hardly be civil to stay.  So she
held out her hand.  "Good-bye, till we meet again!"
she said as cheerfully as she could.
<P>
"I shouldn't know you again if we <EM>did</EM> meet,"
Humpty Dumpty replied in a discontented tone,
giving her one of his fingers to shake; "you're so
exactly like other people.
<P>
"The <EM>face</EM> is what one goes by, generally," Alice
remarked in a thoughtful tone.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/glass28.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
"That's just what I complain of," said Humpty
Dumpty.  "Your face is the same as everybody
has--the two eyes, so---" (marking their places in
the air with his thumb) "nose in the middle, mouth
under.  It's always the same.  Now if you had the
two eyes on the same side of the nose, for instance
or the mouth at the top--that would be <EM>some</EM> help."
<P>
"It wouldn't look nice," Alice objected.  But
Humpty Dumpty only shut his eyes and said,
"Wait till you've tried."
<P>
Alice waited a minute to see if he would speak
again, but as he never opened his eyes or took any
further notice of her, she said, "Good-bye!" once
more, and, on getting no answer to this, she quietly
walked away: but she couldn't help saying to
herself as she went, "Of all the unsatisfactory---"
(she repeated this aloud, as it was a great comfort to
have such a long word to say) "of all the
unsatisfactory people I <EM>ever</EM> met---" She never finished
the sentence, for at this moment a heavy crash
shook the forest from end to end.
