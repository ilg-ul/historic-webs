<P>
This HTML document was produced from the second Texinfo edition
of a well-known book entitled <B>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</B> 
written by <I>Lewis Carroll</I>, alias <I>Charles Lutwidge Dodgson</I>.
<P>
The original was first published in Great Britain in 1865.
Alo contained herein, you'll find the sequel
<B>Through the Looking Glass and what Alice found there</B>,
that was first published in Great Britain in 1872.
<P>
Both of these original editions owe much to the illustrations by
<I>Sir John Tenniels</I>.
All of these 42 + 50 images are included in this edition of this
online version.
<P>
Well, you should not really read the book here, you should download the 
compressed version from an archive and feed it into your local system. 
The default server of this project is
<VAR>
ftp.Germany.EU.net</VAR>, the directory is 
<VAR>pub/books/carroll</VAR>.

There you find the PostScript, TeX DVI, GNU Info, HTML and ASCII versions;
plus the complete Texinfo sources of this document (edn 2.0).

<B>Note from EUnet Romania</B>: if you connect to our server from abroad, 
please do not read this book from here. Our line is too slow and too 
expensive (for us!) to allow you to see all the nice pictures included
in this book. Having much faster lines, please connect to 
http://www.Germany.EU.net. Thank you for your understanding.
