This is <EM>Texinfo</EM> edition 2.1 of <TT>`alice.texi'</TT> as of November 1, 1994.
This document was initially created by J&ouml;rg Heitk&ouml;tter on December 30, 1993.

The <EM>Texinfo</EM> edition originated from Michael Hawley's plain ASCII text files,
available from <SAMP>`world.std.com'</SAMP>, in the Open Book Initiative's (OBI) Gopher Hole.

<P>
Welcome to the second Texinfo edition of <EM>"Alice in Wonderland"</EM>.
This project started some time ago, during a trip to Edinburgh,
Scotland. Back in 1993, I found myself strolling through a shopping mall at
Weaverley Station, where I came across a big (and cheap) volume entitled
<A HREF="images/carroll.gif"><I>``The Complete Illustrated Works of Lewis Carroll'',</I></A>
published by Chancellor Press, London, UK. (ISBN-0-907486-215)
<P>
I couldn't resist the temptation to read the <EM>original</EM>, before, I had
only read German translations of Lewis' writings, and the final consequences
of this shopping experience, is now at your fingertips, when you read these
lines online, hooked into cyberspace.
<P>
However, this is not the first electronically readable version, instead I
could build upon former work carried out by Michael Hawley.<A NAME="FOOT1" HREF="alice_foot.html#FOOT1">(1)</A>
His OCR scanned ASCII version of the two volumes
contained in this edition, is available for everybody connected to the
global communications network, the so-called "Internet," for brevity most
often referred to as "The Net."
<P>
It seems that there are several versions of Alice's Adventures around,
that are slightly different in typography and print, and even some sentences
seem to be altered, with respect to the language used.
The above mentioned book, thus served as the definite reference, whenever
questions arose, while converting Michael's version to Texinfo format.

<P>
<EM>Lewis Carroll</EM>, alias Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, was born in 1832 in
Daresbury, a village in Cheshire, NW England, a few miles SW of the town
of Warrington.
<P>
He was not a full professor of mathematics and logic at Oxford University,
as the rumor goes. Instead, he was (until he resigned) a "Fellow"
(part of the faculty that teaches undergrads<A NAME="FOOT2" HREF="alice_foot.html#FOOT2">(2)</A>) at Christ Church (a college of Oxford University).
Like his father, who was the parson of Daresbury, he was a clergyman.
The church now contains a stained-glass window depicting the White Rabbit
(and possibly other Wonderland characters?).
<P>
Carroll published many pieces on Euklidian and Non-Euklidian geometry, and computation
of determinants. The classical story is that Queen Victoria was so enchanted
by the first Alice book that she asked him to dedicate his
next one to her. He obliged by dedicating <I>An Elementary Treatise
on Determinants</I> to her; once again, Q-V- was "not amused".
(So this guy really had a good portion of British humor.)
<P>
But generally, his mathematical work is not regarded as of being of any
significance. However, with <I>Pillow Problems</I> a column for a periodical he
edited, which can be thought of a pre-cursor of the Mathematical Recreations
(and Computer Recreations) column in todays "Scientific American," he
contributed much to the popularization of mathematics, rather than
mathematical research. But even this is a very hard to accomplish task
of it's very own right. (As all those teaching mathematics, or logic will
know...)
<P>
Only recently, in a 1993 issue of <I>The History of Mathematics</I>, Francine F.
Abeles of the Dept. of Mathematics and Computer Science at Kean College of
New Jersey, published a paper entitled <I>Charles L. Dodgson's Geometric
Approach to Arctangent Relations for Pi</I>.<A NAME="FOOT3" HREF="alice_foot.html#FOOT3">(3)</A>
The abstract reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Approximating pi and attempting to square the circle have a long and
interesting history. In 1875, C.L. Dodgson began work on a computationally
simple approximation method for would-be circle squarers that would convince
them of the futility of their attempts. Relating the earlier geometric and
newer analytic approaches in a practical way, this method produces an
accurate approximation for pi efficiently.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
His two pieces, <EM>"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"</EM>, first
published in 1865 and <EM>"Through the Looking-Glass and what
Alice found there"</EM>, first published in 1872, have become well-known
parts of the history of literature.
<P>
Lewis Carroll died 1898 in Guildford, England.

<P>
Thanks to the following individuals who helped in de-mystifying some
of the background of Lewis Carroll's biography. In the order I
received their contributions, thanks to:
Torkel Franzen, Robert Hill, IGOR, William H. Rowan, Shimpei Yamashita,
Alec McKenzie, D.P. Laurie, Richard R. Carlton, Phil Gibbs, Lionel Cons,
Herman Rubin, Peter Lamb, David J. Snook, N. Shirlene Pearson, Dave Joyce, 
Brian Stewart, and B. Markus Jakobsson. Iain A.F. Fleming, later clarified
two more quirks in the initial release of the 2nd edition.
<P>
Thanks to Rainer Klute for a fast
<I>Hey Rainer, I need a scanner...</I> job (on a rainy saturday afternoon at
UniDO), that gave me the first pictures.
<P>
Reports on this half-finished version have been broadcast on German TV
(Aspekte on ARD, Neues on 3Sat, etc.), in special features during the
1994 Frankfurt book fair. Jens Jansen provided all other images scanned
at 400 DPI, so there shall be a print-it-yourself kit <EM>including</EM>
the pictures real soon now.
<P>
I'd like to dedicate this edition to <EM>Marianne Mueller</EM>---she
knows why.
<P>
Enjoy!
