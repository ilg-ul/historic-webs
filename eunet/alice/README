          Welcome to the Texinfo edition of:

               ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND/
               THROUGH THE LOOKING-GLASS
                    by Lewis Carroll

          Literary Freeware:  Not for Commercial Use
   Copyright (c) 1994 The WindSpiel Company. A JOKE Production.

				# 

   This version of the well-known book by Lewis Carroll is reproduced
in the GNU Texinfo format, i.e., a TeX macro package developed at the *Free
Software Foundation* that allows for easy "online manual" creation, while
being convertible into a variety of different other formats.

This "convertability scheme" has been extended in this project to the use
of various PostScript typefaces. What does this mean for you? Well, you can
print this book in any PS font you like, provided you have a certain
set of freely available tools installed on your system.

These tools are: TeX 3.14 and dvips(1) 5.5xx. That's all folks!
(Hmmm, at least if you work on an unixoid system, that has a C-shell installed,
in worst case, you'll have to read the "configure" script, and follow the steps
by hand :-(

That's why this distribution comes with some pre-generated versions, that
should suit most needs, and for the *hackers* there's the "print-it-yourself"
kit:

          |-README                   this file
          |-CONTENTS                 contents of Alice in Wonderland, etc
          |-alice-2.0-US.dvi.gz	     TeX DVI, US letter size
          |-alice-2.0-US.ps.gz       Computer Modern PostScript, US letter
          |-alice-2.0.dvi.gz         TeX DVI, A4 metric paper
|-carroll-|-alice-2.0.ps.gz          Computer Modern PostScript, A4 paper
          |-alice-2.0.info.gz        GNU Info format
          |-alice-2.0.tar.gz         the "print-it-yourself" kit
          |-alice-2.0.txt.gz         formatted ASCII
          |-alice-2.0.html.tar.gz    HTML version (World-Wide Web)


				# 

   Anyway, in the best case, you unpack the "print-it-yourself kit", type
in something like:

	example% configure --a4 --font palatino
	example% make ps

To get the book on A4 (metric) paper, in the Palatino typeface. And print out
the resulting PostScript file on your PostScript printer. For Computer Modern
type fonts, i.e., the standard TeX fonts just don't use the "--font" option:

	example% configure --a4
	example% make

This is especially useful, if you don't want (or can't) use the PostScript
option, but want to get a TeX DVI file only, to print this.

As for the PostScript option: included are "times" = Times Roman, "palatino"
= Palatino, "bookman" = Bookman, and "newcentury" = New Centry Schoolbook
font files. But from the files in the "fonts" dir it's really straight
forward to add support for other typefaces.)

				# 

   Hackers (or other curious folks) should look into the "fonts" directory
and examine "texinfo.foo", in conjunction with a peek into "configure", to
see what's going on here. But anyway, all this is IMHO very easy to grasp.
It should also be easy to add *any* available PostScript font.
