The Lion and The Unicorn</A></H1>
<P>
THE next moment soldiers came running
through the wood, at first in twos and threes,
then ten or twenty together, and at last in such
crowds that they seemed to fill the whole forest.
Alice got behind a tree, for fear of being run over,
and watched them go by.
<P>
She thought that in all her life she had never seen
soldiers so uncertain on their feet: they were always
tripping over something or other, and whenever one
went down, several more always fell over him, so
that the ground was soon covered with little heaps
of men.
<P>
Then came the horses.  Having four feet, these
managed rather better than the foot-soldiers: but
even <EM>they</EM> stumbled now and then; and it seemed to
be a regular rule that, whenever a horse stumbled,
the rider fell off instantly.  The confusion got worse
every moment, and Alice was very glad to get into
an open place, where she found the White King
seated on the ground, busily writing in his
memorandum-book.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/glass29.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
"I've sent them all!" the King cried in a tone of
delight, on seeing Alice.  "Did you happen to meet
any soldiers, my dear, as you came through the
wood?"
<P>
"Yes, I did," said Alice: "several thousand, I
should think."
<P>
"Four thousand two hundred and seven, that's
the exact number," the King said, referring to his
book.  "I couldn't send all the horses, you know,
because two of them are wanted in the game.  And
I haven't sent the two Messengers, either.  They've
both gone to the town.  Just look along the road,
and tell me if you can see either of them."
<P>
"I see nobody on the road," said Alice.
<P>
"I only wish <EM>I</EM> had such eyes," the King
remarked in a fretful tone.  "To be able to see N
obody!  And at that distance too!  Why, it's as much
as <EM>I</EM> can do to see real people, by this light!"
<P>
All this was lost on Alice, who was still looking
intently along the road, shading her eyes with one
hand.  "I see somebody now!" she exclaimed at
last.  "But he's coming very slowly--and what
curious attitudes he goes into!" (For the M
essenger kept skipping up and down, and wriggling like
an eel, as he came along, with his great hands
spread out like fans on each side.)
<P>
"Not at all," said the King.  "He's an Anlo-Saxon
Messenger--and those are Anglo-Saxon
attitudes.  He only does them when he's happy.
His name is Haigha." (He pronounced it so as to
rhyme with "mayor.")
<P>
"I love my love wih an H," Alice couldn't help
beginning, "because he is Happy.  I hate him with
an H, because he is Hideous.  I fed him wit--
hwith--with Ham-sandwiches and Hay.  His name
is Haigha, and he lives---"
<P>
"He lives on the Hill," the King remarked
simply, without the least idea that he was joining
in the game, while Alice was still hesitating for the
name of a town beginning with H. "The other
Messenger's called Hatta.  I must have <EM>two,</EM> you
know--to come and go.  One to come, and one to
go."
<P>
"I beg your pardon?" said Alice.
<P>
"It isn't respectable to beg," said the King.
<P>
"I only meant that I didn't understand," said
Alice.  "Why one to come and one to go?"
<P>
"Don't I tell you?" the King repeated
impatiently.  "I must have <EM>two--</EM>to fetch and carry.  One
to fetch, and one to carry."
<P>
At this moment the Messenger arrived: he was
far too much out of breath to say a word, and could
only wave his hands about, and make the most
fearful faces at the poor King.
<P>
"This young lady loves you with an H," the
King said, introducing Alice in the hope of turning
off the Messenger's attention from himself--but It
was no use--the Anglo-Saxon attitudes only got
more extraordinary every moment, while the great
eyes rolled wildly from side to side.
<P>
"You alarm me!" said the King.  "I feel faint---
give me a ham sandwich!"
<P>
On which the Messenger, to Alice's great
amusement, opened a bag that hung round his neck, and
handed a sandwich to the King, who devoured it
greedily.
<P>
"Another sandwich!" said the King.
<P>
"There's nothing but hay left now," the M
essenger said, peeping into the bag.
<P>
"Hay, then," the King faintly murmured.
<P>
Alice was glad to see that it revived him a good
deal.
<P>
"There's nothing like eating hay when you're
faint," he remarked to her, as he munched away.
<P>
"I should think throwing cold water over you
would be better," Alice suggested: "---or some
salvolatile."
<P>
"I didn't say there was nothing <EM>better,</EM>" the King
replied.  "I said there was nothing <EM>like</EM> it."  Which
Alice did not venture to deny.
<P>
"Who did you pass on the road?" the King went
on, holding out his hand to the Messenger for some
more hay.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/glass30.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
"Nobody," said the Messenger.
<P>
"Quite right," said the King: "this young lady
saw him too.  So of course Nobody walks slower
than you.
<P>
"I do my best," the Messenger said in a sullen
tone.  "I'm sure nobody walks much faster than I
do!"
<P>
"He can't do that," said the King, "or else he'd
have been here first.  However, now you've got
your breath, you may tell us what's happened in
the town."
<P>
"I'll whisper it," said the Messenger, putting his
hands to his mouth in the shape of a trumpet and
stooping so as to get close to the King's ear.  Alice
was sorry for this, as she wanted to hear the news
too- However, instead of whispering, he simply
shouted at the top of his voice.  "They're at it
again!"
<P>
"Do you call <EM>that </EM> a whisper!" cried the poor
King, jumping up and shaking himself.  "If you do
such a thing again I'll have you buttered!  It went
through and through my head like an earthquake!"
<P>
"It would have to be a very tiny earthquake!"
thought Alice.  "Who are at it again?" she ventured
<P>
"Why the Lion and the Unicorn of course,"
<P>
"Fighting for the crown?
<P>
"Yes, to be sure," said the King; "and the best of
the joke is, that it's <EM>my</EM> crown all the while!  Let's
run and see them."  And they trotted off, Alice
repeating to herself, as she ran, the words of the old
song:---
<P>
<PRE>
<EM>The Lion and the Unicorn were fighting for the crown:
The Lion beat the Unicorn all round the town.
Some gave them white bread and some gave them brown:
Some gave them plum-cake and drummed them out of town.</EM>
</PRE>
<P>
"Does--the one--that wins--get the crown?"
she asked, as well as she could, for the long run was
putting her quite out of breath.
<P>
"Dear me, no!" said the King.  "What an
idea!"
<P>
"Would you--be good enough---" Alice
panted out, after running a little further, "to stop a
minute--just to get--one's -breath again?"
<P>
"I'm <EM>good</EM> enough," the King said, "only I'm not
strong enough.  You see, a minute goes by so
fearfully quick.  You might as well try to stop a B
andersnatch!"
<P>
Alice had no more breath for talking, so they
trotted on in silence, till they came in sight of a
great crowd, in the middle of which the Lion and
Unicorn were fighting.  They were in such a cloud
of dust, that at first Alice could not make out which
was which: but she soon managed to distinguish
the Unicorn by his horn.
<P>
They placed themselves close to where Hatta, the
other Messenger, was standing watching the fight,
with a cup of tea in one hand and a piece of bread
and butter in the other.
<P>
"He's only just out of prison, and he hadn't
finished his tea when he was sent in," Haigha
whispered to Alice: "and they only give them
oystershells in there--so you see he's very hungry and
thirsty.  How are you, dear child?" he went on,
putting his arm affectionately round Hatta's neck.
<P>
Hatta looked round and nodded, and went on
with his bread-and-butter.
<P>
"Were you happy in prison, dear child?" said
Haigha.
<P>
Hatta looked round once more, and this time a
tear or two trickled down his cheek: but not a word
<P>
"Speak, can't you!"  Haigha cried imp
<P>
"Speak, won't you!" cried the King.  "How are
they getting on with the fight?"
<P>
Hatta made a desperate effort, and swallowed a
large piece of bread-and-butter.  "They're getting
on very well," he said in a choking voice: "each of
them has been down about eighty-seven times."
<P>
"Then I suppose they'll soon bring the white
"bread and the brown?"  Alice ventured to remark.
<P>
"It's waiting for 'em now," said Hatta: "this is a
bit of it as I'm eating."
<P>
There was a pause in the fight just then, and the
Lion and the Unicorn sat down, panting, while the
King called out "Ten minutes allowed for
refreshments!"  Haigha and Hatta set to work at once,
carrying round trays of white and brown bread.
Alice took a piece to taste, but it was <EM>very</EM> dry.
<P>
"I don't think they'll fight any more to-day," the
King said to Hatta: "go and order the drums to
begin."  And Hatta went bounding away like a
grasshopper.
<P>
For a minute or two Alice stood silently
watching him.  suddenlyshe brightened up look,
look!" she cried, pointing eagerly.  "There's the
White Queen running across the country!  She
came flying out of the wood over yonder--how fast
those Queens <EM>can</EM> run!"
<P>
"There's some enemy after her, no doubt," the
King said, without even looking round.  "That
wood's full of them."
<P>
"But aren't you going to run and help her?"  Alice
asked, very much surprised at his taking it so
quietly.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/glass31.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
"No use, no use!" said the King.  "She runs so
fearfully quick.  You might as well try to catch a
Bandersnatch!  But I'll make a memorandum about
her, if you like--she's a dear good creature," he
repeated softly to himself, as he opened his
memo-randum-book.  "Do you spell `creature' with a
double `e'?"
<P>
At this moment the Unicorn sauntered by them,
with his hands in his pockets.  "I had the best of it
this time!" he said to the King, just glancing at him
as he passed,
<P>
"A little--a little," the King replied, rather
nervously.  "You shouldn't have run him through with
your horn, you know."
<P>
"It didn't hurt him" the Unicorn said carelessly,
and he was going on, when his eye happened to fall
upon Alice: he turned round instantly, and stood
for some time looking at her with an air of the
deepest disgust
<P>
"What--is--this?" he said at last.
<P>
"This is a child!"  Haigha replied eagerly, coming
in front of Alice to introduce her, and spreading out
both his hands towards her in an Anglo-Saxon
attitude.  "We only found it to-day.  It's as large as life,
and twice as natural!"
<P>
"I always thought they were fabulous monsters!"
said the Unicorn.  "Is it alive?"
<P>
"It can talk," said Haigha, solemnly.
<P>
The unicorn looked dreamily at Alice, and said,
child."
<P>
Alice could not help her lips curling up into a
smile as she began: "Do you know, I always,
thought Unicorns were fabulous monsters, too!  I
never saw one alive before!"
<P>
"Well, now that we <EM>have</EM> seen each other: said
The Unicorn,"if you'll believe in me, I'll believe in
you.  Is that a bargain?
<P>
"Yes, if you like," said Alice.
<P>
"Come, fetch out the plum-cake, old man!" the
Unicorn went on, turning from her to the King.
"None of your brown bread for me!"
<P>
"Certainly -- certainly!" the King muttered, and
beckoned to Haigha.  "Open the bag!" he
whispered.  "Quick!  Not that one--that's full of hay!"
<P>
Haigha took a large cake out of the bag, and gave
it to Alice to hold, while he got out a dish and
carv-ing-knife.  How they all came out of it Alice
couldn't guess.  It was just like a conjuring trick,
she thought.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/glass32.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
The Lion had joined them while this was going
on: he looked very tired and sleepy, and his eyes
were half shut.  "What's this?" he said, blinking
lazily at Alice, and speaking in a deep hollow tone
that sounded like the tolling of a great bell.
<P>
"Ah, what <EM>is</EM> it, now ?" the Unicorn cried eagerly,
"You'll never guess!  I couldn't."
<P>
The Lion looked at Alice wearily.  "Are you
animal--or vegetable--or mineral?" he said,
yawning at every other word
<P>
"It's a fabulous monster!" the Unicorn cried
out, before Alice could reply.
<P>
"Then hand round the plum-cake, Monster," the
Lion said, lying down and putting his chin on his
paws.  "And sit down, both of you" (to the King and
the Unicorn): "fair play with the cake, you know!"
<P>
The King was evidently very uncomfortable at
having to sit down between the two great creatures;
but there was no other place for him.
<P>
"What a fight we might have for the crown,
<EM>now!</EM>" the Unicorn said, looking slyly up at the
crown, which the poor King was nearly shakin off
his head, he trembled so much.
<P>
"I should win easy," said the Lion.
<P>
"I'm not so sure of that," said the Unicorn.
<P>
"Why, I beat you all round the town, you
chicken!" the Lion replied angrily, half getting up
as he spoke.
<P>
Here the king interupted, to prevent the quarrel
going on: he was very nervous, and his voice quite
quivered.  "Ali round the town?" he said.  "That's
a good long way.  Did you go by the old bridge, or
the market-place?  You get the best view by the old
bridge."
<P>
"I'm sure I don't know the Lion growled out
as he lay down again.  "There was too much dust to
see anything.  What a time the Monster is, cutting
up that cake!"
<P>
Alice had seated herself on the bank of a little
brook, with the great dish on her knees, and was sawinf away
diligently with the knife.
"It's very provoking!" she said, in reply to the Lion (she was
getting quite used to being called "the Monster )"
"I've cut off several slices already, but they always
join on again!"
<P>
"You don't know how to manage Looking-glass
cakes," the Unicorn remarked.  "Hand it round
first, and cut it afterwards."
<P>
This sounded nonsense, but Alice very
obediently got up, and carried the dish round, and the
cake divided itself into three pieces as she did so.
<EM>"Now</EM> cut it up," said the Lion, as she returned to
her place with the empty dish.
<P>
"I say, this isn't fair!" cried the Unicorn, as Alice
sat with the knife in her hand, very much puzzled
how to begin.  "The Monster has given the Lion
twice as much as me!"
<P>
"She's kept none for herself, anyhow," said the
But before Alice could answer him the drums
began.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/glass33.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
Where the noise came from, she couldn't make out:
the air seemed full of it, and it rang through
She started to her feet, and sprang across the little
brook in her terror, and had just time to see the
Lion and the Unicorn rise to their feet, with angry
looks at being interrupted in their feast, before she
dropped to her knees and put her hands over her
ears, vainly trying to shut out the dreadful uproar.
<P>
"If <EM>that</EM> doesn't `drum them out of town,' " she
thought to herself, "nothing ever will!"
