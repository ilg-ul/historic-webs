Advice from a Caterpillar</A></H1>
<P>
THE Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other
for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar
took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed
her in a languid sleepy voice.
<P>
"Who are <EM>you?</EM>" said the Caterpillar.
<P>
This was not an encouraging opening for a
conversation.  Alice replied, rather shyly, "I--I hardly
know, sir, just at present--at least I know who I
<EM>was</EM> when I got up this morning, but I think I must
have been changed several times since then."
<P>
"What do you mean by that?" said the C
aterpillar sternly.  "Explain yourself!"
<P>
"I can't explain <EM>myself,</EM> I'm afraid, sir," said
Alice, "because I'm not myself, you see."
<P>
"I don't see," said the Caterpillar.
<P>
"I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly," Alice
replied very politely, "for I can't understand it
myself to begin with; and being so many different
sizes in a day is very confusing."
<P>
"It isn't," said the Caterpillar.
<P>
"Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet," said
Alice; "but when you have to turn into a chrysalisyou will some day, you know--and then after that
into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little
queer, won't you?"
<P>
"Not a bit," said the Caterpillar.
<P>
"Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,"
said Alice; "all I know is, it would feel very queer
to <EM>me.</EM>"
<P>
"You!" said the Caterpillar contemptuously.
"Who are <EM>you?</EM>"
<P>
Which brought them back again to the beginning
of the conversation.  Alice felt a little irritated at the
caterpillar's making such <EM>very</EM> short remarks, and
she drew herself up and said, very gravely, "I think
you ought to tell me who <EM>you</EM> are, first."
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/alice15.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
"Why?" said the Caterpillar.
<P>
Here was another puzzling question; and as
Alice could not think of any good reason, and as
the Caterpillar seemed to be in a <EM>very</EM> unpleasant
state of mind, she turned away.
<P>
"Come back!" the Caterpillar called after her.
"I've something important to say!"
<P>
This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned
and came back again.
<P>
"Keep your temper," said the Caterpillar.
<P>
"Is that all?" said Alice, swallowing down her
anger as well as she could.
<P>
"No," said the Caterpillar.
<P>
Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had
nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might
tell her something worth hearing.  For some
minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last
it unfolded its ams, took the hookah out of its
mouth again, and said, "So you think you're
changed, do you ?"
<P>
"I'm afraid I am, sir," said Alice; "I can't
remember things as I used--and I don't keep the
same size for ten minutes together!"
<P>
"Can't remember <EM>what</EM> things?" said the Caterpillar.
<P>
"Well, I've tried to say <EM>'How doth the little busy</EM>
<EM>bee,'</EM> but it all came different!"  Alice replied in a
very melancholy voice.
<P>
"Repeat '<EM>You are old, Father William,</EM>' " said the
Caterpillar.
<P>
Alice folded her hands, and began:---
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/alice16.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
<PRE>
<EM>"You are old, Father William," the young man said,</EM>
<EM>"And your hair has become very white;</EM>
<EM>And yet you incessantly stand on your head--</EM>
<EM>Do you think, at your age, it is right?"</EM>

<EM>"In my youth," Father William replied to his son,</EM>
<EM>"I feared it might injure the brain;</EM>
<EM>But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,</EM>
<EM>Why, I do it again and again."</EM>
<IMG SRC="images/alice17.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">

<EM>"You are old," said the youth, "as I mentioned before,</EM>
<EM>And have grown most uncommonly fat;</EM>
<EM>Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--</EM>
<EM>Pray, what is the reason of that?"</EM>

<EM>"In my youth," said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,</EM>
<EM>"I kept all my limbs very supple</EM>
<EM>by the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--</EM>
<EM>Allow me to sell you a couple?"</EM>

<EM>"You are old," said the youth, "and your jaws are too weak</EM>
<EM>For anything tougher than suet;</EM>
<EM>Pet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--</EM>
<EM>Pray, how did you manage to do it?"</EM>

<EM>"In my youth said his father, "I took the law.</EM>
<EM>And argued each case with my wife;</EM>
<EM>And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,</EM>
<EM>Has lasted the rest of my life."</EM>
<IMG SRC="images/alice18.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">

<EM>"You are old," said the youth, "one would hardly suppose</EM>
<EM>That your eye was as steady as ever;</EM>
<EM>Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--</EM>
<EM>What made you so awfully clever?"</EM>

<EM>"I have answered three questions, and that is enough,"</EM>
<EM>Said his father; "don't give yourself airs!</EM>
<EM>Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?</EM>
<EM>Be off, or I'll kick you downstairs!"</EM>
</PRE>
<P>
"That is not said right," said the Caterpillar.
<P>
"Not <EM>quite</EM> right, I'm afraid," said Alice, timidly;
some of the words have got altered."
<P>
"It is wrong from beginning to end," said the
Caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence for
some minutes.
<P>
The Caterpillar was the first to speak.
<P>
"What size do you want to be?" it asked.
<P>
"Oh, I'm not particular as to size," Alice hastily
replied; "Only one doesn't like changing so often,
you know."
<P>
"I <EM>don't</EM> know," said the Caterpillar.
<P>
Alice said nothing: she had never been so much
contradicted in all her life before, and she felt that
she was losing her temper.
<P>
"Are you content now?" said the Caterpillar.
<P>
"Well, I should like to be a <EM>little</EM> larger, sir, if you
wouldn't mind," said Alice: "three inches is such a
etched height to be."
<P>
"It is a very good height indeed!" said the C
aterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it
was exactly three inches high).
<P>
"But I'm not used to it!" pleaded poor Alice in a
piteous tone.  And she thought to herself, "I wish
the creatures wouldn't be so easily offended!"
<P>
"You'll get used to it in time," said the C
aterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and
began smoking again.
<P>
This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to
speak again.  In a minute or two the Caterpillar
took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once
or twice, and shook itself.  Then it got down off the
mushroom, and crawled away into the grass
merely remarking as it went, "One side will make
you grow taller, and the other side will make you
grow shorter."
<P>
"One side of <EM>what?</EM> The other side of <EM>what.</EM>
thought Alice to herself.
<P>
"Of the mushroom," said the Caterpillar, just
if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it
was out of sight.
<P>
Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom
room for a minute, trying to make out which we
the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she
found this a very difficult question.  However, at last
she stretched her arms round it as far as they would
go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand
<P>
"And now which is which?" she said to herself,
and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the
effect; the next moment she felt a violent blow
underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!
<P>
She was a good deal frightened by this very
sudden change, but she felt that there was no time
to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set
to work at once to eat some of the other bit.  Her
chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that
there was hardly room, to open her mouth; but she
did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of
the left-hand bit.
<P>
"Come, my head's free at last!" said Alice in a
tone of delight, which changed into alarm in
another moment, when she found that her shoulders
were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when
he looked down, was an immense length of neck,
which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of
green leaves that lay far below her.
<P>
"What <EM>can</EM> all that green stuff be?" said Alice.
"And where <EM>have</EM> my shoulders got to?' And oh,
my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?"  She was
moving them about as she spoke, but no result
seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the
distant green leaves.
<P>
As there seemed to be no chance of getting her
ands up to her head, she tried to get her head
down to them, and was delighted to find that her
neck would bend about easily in any direction, like
a serpent.  She had just succeeded in curving it
own into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive
in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing
ut the tops of the trees under which she had been
wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back
in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face,
and was beating her violently with its wings.
<P>
"Serpent!" screamed the Pigeon.
<P>
"I'm <EM>not a</EM> serpent!" said" Alice indignantly.
"Let me alone!"
<P>
"Serpent, I say again!" repeated the Pigeon, but
in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of
sob, "I've tried every way, and nothing seems to
suit them!"
<P>
"I haven't the least idea what you're talking
about," said Alice.
<P>
"I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried, banks
and I've tried hedges," the Pigeon went on, without
attending to her; "but those serpents!  There's no
pleasing them!"
<P>
Alice was more and more puzzled, but she
thought there was no use saying anything more till
the Pigeon had finished.
<P>
"As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the
eggs," said the Pigeon; "but I must be on the look
out for serpents night and day!  Why, I haven't had
a wink of sleep these three weeks!"
<P>
"I'm very sorry you've been annoyed," said
Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning.
<P>
"And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the
wood," continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a
shriek, "and just as I was thinking I should be free
of them at last, they, must needs come wriggling
down from the sky!  Ugh, Serpent!"
<P>
"But I'm <EM>not a</EM> serpent, I tell you!" said Alice
"I'm a--I'm a---"
<P>
"Well!  <EM>What</EM> are you?" said the Pigeon.  "I can
see you're trying to invent something!"
<P>
"I--I'm a little girl," said Alice, rather
doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes
she had gone through that day.
<P>
"A likely story indeed!" said the Pigeon in
tone of the deepest contempt.  "I've seen a good
many little girls in my time, but never <EM>one</EM> with such
a neck as that!  No, no!  You're a serpent; and
There's no use denying it.  I suppose you'll be
telling me next that you never tasted an egg!"
<P>
"I <EM>have</EM> tasted eggs, certainly," said Alice, who
was a very truthful child; "but little girls eat eggs
quite as much as serpents do, you know."
<P>
"I don't believe it," said the Pigeon; "but if they
do, why, then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I
can say."
<P>
This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was
quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the
pigeon the opportunity of adding, "You're looking
for eggs, I know <EM>that</EM> well enough; and what does
matter to me whether you're a little girl or a
serpent ?"
<P>
"It matters a good deal to <EM>me,</EM>" said Alice hastily;
"but I'm not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if
I was, I shouldn't want <EM>yours:</EM> I don't like them
raw."
<P>
"Well, be off then!" said the Pigeon in a sulky
tone, as it settled down again into its nest.  Alice
crouched down among the trees as well as she
could, for her neck kept getting entangled among
the branches, and every now and then she had to '
stop and untwist it.  After a while she remembered
at she still held the pieces of mushroom in her
hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling
it at one and then at the other, and growing
sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she
had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual
height.
<P>
It was so long since she had been anything near
the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but
she got used to it in a few minutes, and began
talking to herself, as usual.  "Come, there's half my
plan done now!  How puzzling all these changes
are!  I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one
minute to another!  However, I've got back to my
right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful
garden--how <EM>is</EM> that to be done, I wonder?"  As she
said this, she came suddenly upon an open place,
with a little house in it about four feet high.  "Who
ever lives there," thought Alice, "it'll never do to
come upon them <EM>this</EM> size: why, I should frighten
them out of their wits!"  So she began nibbling
at the right-hand bit again, and did not venture to
go near the house till she had brought herself down
to nine inches high.
