<P>
This HTML document was produced from the second Texinfo edition
of a well-known book entitled <B>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</B> 
written by <I>Lewis Carroll</I>, alias <I>Charles Lutwidge Dodgson</I>.
<P>
The original was first published in Great Britain in 1865.
Alo contained herein, you'll find the sequel
<B>Through the Looking Glass and what Alice found there</B>,
that was first published in Great Britain in 1872.
<P>
Both of these original editions owe much to the illustrations by
<I>Sir John Tenniels</I>.
All of these 42 + 50 images are included in this edition of this
online version.
<P>
Well, you should not really read the book here, you should download the 
compressed version from an archive and feed it into your local system.
