Tweedledum and Tweedledee</A></H1>
<P>
THEY were standing under a tree each with an
arm round the other's neck, and Alice knew
which was which in a moment, because one of them
had "DUM" embroidered on his collar, and the other
"DEE." "I suppose they've each got "TWEEDLE"
round at the back of the collar," she said to herseLf,
<P>
They stood so still that she quite forgot they were
alive, and she was just looking round to see if the
word "TWEEDLE" was written at the back of each
collar, when she was startled by a voice coming
from the one marked "DUM."
<P>
"If you think we're wax-works," he said, "you
ought to pay, you know.  Wax-works weren't made
to be looked at for nothing.  Nohow!"
<P>
"Contrariwise" added the one marked "DEE",
"if you think we're alive, you ought to speak."
<P>
"I'm sure I'm very sorry," was all Alice could
say; for the words of the old song kept ringing
through her head like the ticking of a clock, and
she could hardly help saying them out loud:---
<P>
<PRE>
<EM>Tweedledum and Tweedledee
Agreed to have a battle;
For Tweedledum said Tweedledee
Had spoiled his nice new rattle.</EM>

<EM>Just then flew down a monstrous crow,
As black as a tar-barrel;
Which frightened both the heroes so,
They quite forgot their quarrel.</EM>
</PRE>
<P>
"I know what you're thinking about," said
Tweedledum: "but it isn't so, nohow."
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/glass16.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
"Contrariwise," continued Tweedledee, "if it
was so, it might be; and if it were so, it would be:
but as it isn't, it ain't. 'That's logic."
<P>
"I was thinking," Alice said very politely, "which
is the best way out of this wood: it's getting so dark.
Would you tell me, please ?"
<P>
But the fat little men only looked at each other
and grinned.
<P>
They looked so exactly like a couple of great
schoolboys, that Alice couldn't help pointing her
finger at Tweedledum, and saying, "First Boy!"
<P>
"Nohow!"  Tweedledum cried out briskly, and
instantly shut his mouth up again with a snap.
<P>
"Next Boy!" said Alice, passing on to T
weedledee, though she felt quite certain he would only
shout out "Contrariwise!" and so he did.
<P>
"You've begun wrong!" cried Tweedledum.
"The first thing in a visit is to say, "How d'ye do?'
and shake hands!"  And here the two brothers gave
each other a hug, and then they held out the two
hands that were free, to shake hands with her.
<P>
Alice did not like shaking hands with either of
them first, for fear of hurting the other one's
feelings; so, as the best way out of the difficulty, she
took hold of both hands at once: the next moment
they were dancing round in a ring.  This seemed
quite natural (she remembered afterwards), and she
was not even surprised to hear music playing: it
seemed to come from the tree under which they
were dancing, and it was done (as well as she could
make it out) by the branches rubbing one across the
other, like fiddles and fiddlesticks.
<P>
"But it certainly <EM>was</EM> funny" (Alice said
afterwards, when she was telling her sister the history
of all this) "to find myself singing <EM>"Here we go round</EM>
<EM>the mulberry bush.'</EM> I don't know when I began it,
but somehow I felt as if I'd been singing it a long,
long time!"
<P>
The other two dancers were fat, and very soon
out of breath.  "Four times round is enough for one
dance," Tweedledum panted out, and they left off
dancing as suddenly as they had begun: the music
stopped at the same moment.
<P>
Then they let go of Alice's hands, and stood
looking at her for a minute: there was a rather awkward
pause, as Alice didn't know how to begin a
conversation with people she had just been dancing
with.  "It would never do to say "How d'ye do?
<EM>now,</EM>" she said to herself: "we seem to have got
beyond that, somehow!"
<P>
"I hope you're not much tired?" she said at last.
<P>
"Nohow.  And thank you <EM>very</EM> much for asking,"
said Tweedledum.
<P>
"So <EM>much</EM> obliged!" added Tweedledee.  "You
like poetry?"
<P>
"Ye-es, pretty well--<EM>some</EM> poetry," Alice said
doubtfully.  "Would you tell me which road leads
out of the wood?"
<P>
"What shall I repeat to her?" said Tweedledee
looking round at Tweedledum with great solemn
eyes, and not noticing Alice's question.
<P>
"<EM>'The Walrus and the Carpenter'</EM> is the longest,"
Tweedledum replied, giving his brother an
affectionate hug.
<P>
Tweedledee began instantly:
<P>
<PRE>
<EM>"The sun was shining---"</EM>
</PRE>
<P>
Here Alice ventured to interrupt.  "If it's <EM>very</EM>
long," she said, as politely as she could, "would
you tell me first which road---"
<P>
Tweedledee smiled gently, and began again:
<P>
<PRE>
<EM>The sun was shining on the sea,
Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright--
And this was odd, because it was
The middle of the night.</EM>

<EM>The moon was shining sulkily,
Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
After the day was done--
"It's very rude of him," she said,
"To come and spoil the fun!"</EM>

<EM>The sea was wet as wet could be,
The sands were dry as dry.
You could not see a cloud, because
No cloud was in the sky:
No birds were flying overhead--
There were no birds to fly.</EM>

<EM>The Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking close at hand;
They wept like anything to see
Such quantities of sand:
"If this were only cleared away,"
They said, "it would be grand!"</EM>
<IMG SRC="images/glass17.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">

<EM>"If seven maids with seven mops
Swept it for half a year.
Do you suppose," the Walrus said,
"That they could get it clear?"
"I doubt it," said the Carpenter,
And shed a bitter tear.</EM>

<EM>"O Oysters, come and walk with us.!"
The Walrus did beseech.
"A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
Along the briny beach:
We cannot do with more than four,
To give a hand to each."</EM>

<EM>The eldest Oyster looked at him,
But never a word he said:
The eldest Oyster winked his, eye,
And shook his heavy head--
Meaning to say he did not choose
To leave the oyster-bed.</EM>

<EM>But four young Oysters hurried up,
All eager for the treat:
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
Their shoes were clean and neat--
And this was odd, because, you know,
They hadn't any feet.</EM>

<EM>Four other Oysters followed them,
And yet another four;
And thick and fast they came at last,
And more, and more, and more--
All hopping through the frothy waves,
And scrambling to the shore.</EM>

<EM>The Walrus and the Carpenter
Walked on a mile or so,
And then they rested on a rock
Conveniently low:
And all the little Oysters stood
And waited in a row.</EM>

<EM>"The time has come," the Walrus said,
"To talk of many things:
Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--
Of cabbages--and kings--
And why the sea is boiling hot--
And whether pigs have wings."</EM>
<IMG SRC="images/glass18.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">

<EM>"But wait a bit," the Oysters cried,
"Before we have our chat;
For some of us are out of breath,
And all of us are fat!"
"No hurry!" said the Carpenter.
They thanked him much for that.</EM>

<EM>"A loaf of bread," the Walrus said,
"Is what we chiefly need:
Pepper and vinegar besides
Are very good indeed--
Now if you're ready, Oysters dear,
We can begin to feed."</EM>

<EM>"But not on us!" the Oysters cried,
Turning a little blue.
"After such kindness, that would be
A dismal thing to do!"
"The night is fine," the Walrus said.
"Do you admire the view?</EM>

<EM>"It was so kind of you to come!
And you are very nice!"
The Carpenter said nothing but
"Cut us another slice:
I wish you were not quite so deaf--
I've had to ask you twice!"</EM>
<IMG SRC="images/glass19.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">

<EM>"It seems a shame," the Walrus said,
"To play them such a trick,
After we've brought them out so far,
And made them trot so quick!"
The Carpenter said nothing but
"The butter's spread too thick!"</EM>

<EM>"I weep for you," the Walrus said:
"I deeply sympathize."
With sobs and tears he sorted out
Those of the largest size,
Holding his pocket-handkerchief
Before his streaming eyes.</EM>

<EM>"O Oysters," said the Carpenter,
"You've had a pleasant run!
Shall we be trotting home again?'
But answer came there none--
And this was scarcely odd, because
They'd eaten every one."</EM>
</PRE>
<P>
"I like the Walrus best," said Alice: "because
you see he was a <EM>little</EM> story for the poor oysters."
<P>
"He ate more than the Carpenter, though" said
Tweedledee.  "You see he held his handkerchief in
front, so that the Carpenter couldn't count how
many he took: contrariwise."
<P>
"That was mean!"  Alice said indignantly.  "Then
I like the Carpenter best--if he didn't eat so many
as the Walrus."
<P>
"But he ate as many as he could get," said
Tweedledum.
<P>
This was a puzzler.  After a pause, Alice began,
"Well!  They were <EM>both</EM> very unpleasant
characters---" Here she checked herself in some alarm,
at hearing something that sounded to her like the
puffng of a large steam-engine in the wood near
them, though she feared it was more likely to be a
wild beast.
"Are there any lions or tigers about here?" she
asked timidly.
<P>
"lt's only the Red King snoring," said Tweedledee.
<P>
"Come and look at him!" the brothers cried, and
they each took one of Alice's hands, and led her up
to where the King was sleeping.
<P>
"Isn't he a <EM>lovely</EM> sight?" said Tweedledum.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/glass20.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
Alice couldn't say honestly that he was.  He had a
tall red night-cap on, with a tassel, and he was lying
crumpled up into a sort of untidy heap, and snoring
loud--"fit to snore his head off!" as Tweedledum
remarked.
<P>
"I'm afraid he'll catch cold with lying on the
damp grass," said Alice, who was a very thoughtful
little girl.
<P>
"He's dreaming now," said Tweedledee: "and
what do you think he's dreaming about?"
<P>
Alice said, "Nobody can guess that."
<P>
"Why, about <EM>you</EM>!"  Tweedledee exclaimed,
clapping his hands triumphantly.  "And if he left off
dreaming about you, where do you suppose you'd
be?"
<P>
"Where I am now, of course," said Alice.
<P>
"Not you!"  Tweedledee retorted
contemptuously.  "You'd be nowhere.  Why, you're only a
sort of thing in his dream!"
<P>
"If that there King was to wake," added T
weedledum, "you'd go out--bang!--just llke a candle!"
<P>
"I shouldn't!"  Alice exclaimed indignantly.  "Besides,
if <EM>I'm</EM> only a sort of thing in his dream, what
are <EM>you, I</EM> should like to know?"
<P>
"Ditto," said Tweedledum.
<P>
"Ditto, ditto!" cried Tweedledee.
<P>
He shouted this so loud that Alice couldn't help
saying, "Hush!  You'll be waking him, I'm afraid,
if you make so much noise."
<P>
"Well, it's no use <EM>your</EM> talking about waking
him," said Tweedledum, "when you're only one of
the things in his dream.  You know very well you're
not real."
<P>
"I <EM>am</EM> real!" said Alice, and began to cry.
<P>
"You won't make yourself a bit realer by
crying," Tweedledee remarked: "there's nothing to cry
about."
<P>
"If I wasn't real," Alice said--half-laughing
through her tears, it all seemed so ridiculous--
"I shouldn't be able to cry."
<P>
"I hope you don't suppose those are real tears?"
Tweedledum interrupted in a tone of great
contempt.
<P>
"I know they're talking nonsense," Alice thought
to herself: "and it's foolish to cry about it."  So she
brushed away her tears, and went on as cheerfully
as she could, "At any rate I'd better be getting out
of the wood, for really it's coming on very dark.
Do you think it's going to rain?"
<P>
Tweedledum spread a large umbrella over
himself and his brother, and looked up into it.  "No, I
don't think it is," he said: "at least--not under <EM>here.</EM>
Nohow."
<P>
"But it may rain <EM>outside?</EM>"
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/glass21.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
"It may--if it chooses," said Tweedledee: "we've
no objection.  Contrariwise."
<P>
"Selfish things!" thought Alice, and she was just
going to say "Good-night" and leave them, when
Tweedledum sprang out from under the umbrella,
and seized her by the wrist.
<P>
"Do you see <EM>that?</EM>" he said in a voice choking
with passion, and his eyes grew large and yellow all
in a moment, as he pointed with a trembling finger
at a small white thing lying under the tree.
<P>
"It's only a rattle," Alice said, after a careful
examination of the little white thing.  "Not a
rattle-<EM>snake,</EM> you know," she added hastily,
thinking that he was frightened: "only an old rattle--
quite old and broken."
<P>
"I knew it was!" cried Tweedledum, beginning to
stamp about wildly and tear his hair.  "It's spoilt, of
course!"  Here he looked at Tweedledee, who
immediately sat down on the ground, and tried to hide
himself under the umbrella.
<P>
Alice laid her hand upon his arm, and said in a
soothing tone, "You needn't be so angry about an
old rattle."
<P>
"But it isn't old!"  Tweedledum cried, in a greater
fury than ever.  "It's new, I tell you--I bought it
yesterday--my nice NEW RATTLE!" and his voice
rose to a perfect scream.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/glass22.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
All this time Tweedledee was trying his best to
fold up the umbrella, with himself in it: which was
such an extraordinary thing to do, that it quite took
off Alice's attention from the angry brother.  But
he couldn't quite succeed, and it ended in his rolling
over, bundled up in the umbrella, with only his head
out: and there he lay, opening and shutting his
mouth and his large eyes--"looking more like a
fish than anything else," Alice thought.
<P>
"Of course you agree to have a battle?"
Tweedledum said in a calmer tone.
<P>
"I suppose so," the other sulkily replied, as he
crawled out of the umbrella: "only <EM>she</EM> must help
us to dress up, you know."
<P>
So the two brothers went off hand-in-hand into
the wood, and returned in a minute with their arms
full of things--such as bolsters, blankets,
hearthrugs, table-cloths, dish-covers, and coal-scuttles,
"I hope you're a good hand at pinning and tying
strings?"  Tweedledum remarked.  "Every one of
these things has got to go on, somehow or other."
<P>
Alice said afterwards she had never seen such a
fuss made about anything in all her life--the way
those two bustled about--and the quantity of
things they put on--and the trouble they gave her
in tying strings and fastening buttons--"Really
they'll be more like bundles of old clothes than
anything else, by the time they're ready!" she said to
herself, as she arranged a bolster round the neck of
Tweedledee, "to keep his head from being cut off,"
as he said.
<P>
"You know," he added very gravely, "it's one of
the most serious things that can possibly happen to
one in a battle--to get one's head cut off."
<P>
Alice laughed loud, but managed to turn it into a
cough, for fear of hurting his feelings.
<P>
"Do I look very pale?" said Tweedledum,
coming up to have his helmet tied on. (He <EM>called</EM> it a
helmet, though it certainly looked much more like a
saucepan.)
<P>
"Well--yes--a <EM>little,</EM>" Alice replied gently.
<P>
"I'm very brave generally," he went on in a
low voice: "only to-day I happen to have a
headache."
<P>
"And <EM>I've</EM> got a toothache!" said Tweedledee,
who had overheard the remark.  "I'm far worse
than you!"
<P>
"Then you'd better not fight to-day," said Alice,
thinking it a good opportunity to make peace.
<P>
"We <EM>must</EM> have a bit of a fight, but I don't care
about going on long," said Tweedledum.  "What's
the time now?"
<P>
Tweedledee looked at his watch, and said, "Halfpast four."
<P>
"Let's fight till six, and then have dinner," said
Tweedledum.
<P>
"Very well," the other said, rather sadly: "and
<EM>she</EM> can watch us--only you'd better not come <EM>very</EM>
close," he added: "I generally hit everything I can
see--when I get really excited."
<P>
"And <EM>I</EM> hit everything within reach," cried
Tweedledum, "whether I can see it or not!"
<P>
Alice laughed.  "You must hit the <EM>trees</EM> pretty
often, I should think," she said.
<P>
Tweedledum looked round him with a satisfied
smile.  "I don't suppose," he said, "there'll be a
tree left standing, for ever so far round, by the time
we've finished!"
<P>
"And all about a rattle!" said Alice, still hoping
to make them a <EM>little</EM> ashamed of fighting for such a
trifle.
<P>
"I shouldn't have minded it so much," said
Tweedledum, "if it hadn't been a new one."
<P>
"I wish the monstrous crow would come!"
thought Alice.
<P>
"There's only one sword, you know," Tweedledum
said to his brother: "but you can have the
umbrella--it's quite as sharp.  Only we must begin
quick.  It's getting as dark as it can."
<P>
"And darker," said Tweedledee.
<P>
It was getting dark so suddenly that Alice thought
there must be a thunderstorm coming on.  "What a
thick black cloud that is!" she said.  "And how fast
it comes!  Why, I do believe it's got wings!"
<P>
"It's the crow!" Tweedledum cried out in a shrill
voice of alarm: and the two brothers took to their
heels and were out of sight in a moment.
<P>
Alice ran a little way into the wood, and stopped
under a large tree.  "It can never get at me <EM>here,</EM>"
she thought: "it's far too large to squeeze itself in
among the trees.  But I wish it wouldn't flap its
wings so--it makes quite a hurricane in the wood--
here's somebody's shawl being blown away!"
