Who Stole the Tarts?</A></H1>
<P>
THE King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when
they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them---
all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of
cards: the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on
each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a
trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very
middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it:
the looked so good, that it made Alice qite hungry to look at them --
"I wish they'd get the trial done," she thought, "and hand round the
refreshments!"
But there seemed to be no chance of this; so she began looking at
everything about her to pass away the time.
<P>
Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about
them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name
of nearly everything there. "That's the judge," she said to herself,
"because of his great wig."
<P>
The judge, by the way, was the King; and, as he wore his crown over the
wig (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it), he did
not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.
<P>
"And that's the jury-boy," thought Alice; "and those twelve
creatures," (she was obliged to say "creatures," you see, because
some of them were animals, and some were birds,) "I suppose they are
the jurors." She said this last word two or thre times over to herself,
being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very
few littel girls of her age knew the meaning of it all. However,
"jurymen" would have done just as well.
<P>
The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. "What are
they doing?" Alice whispered to the Gryphon. "They can't have anything
to put down yet, before the trial's begun."
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/alice37.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
"They're putting down their names," the Gryphon whispered in reply,
"for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial."
<P>
Stupid things!" Alice began in a load indignant voice; but she stopped
herself hastily, for the White Rabitt cried out "Silence in the
Court!", and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,
to make out who was talking.
<P>
Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,
that all the jurors were writing down "Stupid things!" on their
slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to
spell "stupid," and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. "A
nice muddle their slates'll be in, before the trial's over!" thought
Alice.
<P>
ne of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This, of course, Alice cout
<EM>not</EM> stand, and she wetn round the court and got behind him, and
very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly
that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out
at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was
obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was
of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.
<P>
"Herald, read the accusation!" said the King.
<P>
On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, an then
unrolled the parchment-scroll, and read as follows:---
<P>
<PRE>
<I>The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
All on a summer day:
The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts
And took them quite away!</I>
</PRE>
<P>
"Consider your verdict," the Kind said to the jury.
"Not yet, not yet!" the Rabbit hastily interrupted. "There's a great
deal to come before that!"
<P>
"Call the first witness," said the King; and the White Rabbit blew
three blasts on the trumpet, and called out "First witness!"
<P>
The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand
and a piece of brea-and-butter in the other. "I beg your pardon, your
Majesty," he began, "for bringing these in; but I hadn't quite
finished my tea when I was sent fore."
<P>
"You ought to have finished," said the King. "When did you begin?"
<P>
The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the
court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. "Fourteenth of March, I
<EM>think</EM> it was," he said.
<P>
"Fifteenth," said the March Hare.
<P>
"Sixteenth," said the Dormouse.
<P>
"Write that down," the King said to the jury; and the jury eagerly
wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and
reduced the answer to shillings and pence.
<P>
"Take off your hat," the king said to the Hatter.
<P>
"It isn't mine," said the Hatter.
<P>
"<EM>Stolen!</EM>" the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who
instantly made a memorandum of the fact.
<P>
"I keep them to sell," the Hatter added as an explanation. "I've non
of my own. I'm a hatter."
<P>
Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring hard at the
Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.
<P>
"Give your evidence," said the King; "and don't be nervous, or I'll
have you executed on the spot."
<P>
This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from
one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his
confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
bread-and-butter.
<P>
Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to
grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave
the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as
long as there was room for her.
<P>
"I wish you wouldn't squeeze so," said the Dormouse, who was sitting
next to her. "I can hardly breathe."
<P>
"I can't help it," said Alice very meekly: "I'm growing."
<P>
"You've got no right to grow <EM>here</EM>," said the Dormouse.
<P>
"Don't talk nonsense," said Alice more boldly: "you know you're
groing too."
<P>
"Yes, but <EM>I</EM> grow at a reasonable pace," said the Dormouse:
"not in that ridiculous fashion." And he got up very sulkily and
crossed over to the other side of the court.
<P>
All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,
just as the Dourmouse crossed the court, she said, to one of the
officers of the court, "Bring me the list of the singers in the last
concert!" on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook off
both his shoes.
<P>
"Give your evidence," the King repeated angrily, "or I'll have you
executed, whether you're nervous or not."
<P>
"I'm a poor man, your Majesty," the Hatter began, in atrembling voice,
"and I hadn't begun my tea -- not above a week or so -- and what with
the bread-and-butter getting so thin -- and the twinkling of the
tea---"
<P>
"The twinkling of <EM>what</EM>?" said the King.
<P>
"It begun with the tea," the Hatter replied.
<P>
"Of course twinkling <EM>begins</EM> with a T!" said the King sharply.
"Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!"
<P>
"I'm a poor man," the Hatter went on, "and most things twinkled after
that -- only the March Hare said---"
<P>
"I didn't!" the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.
<P>
"You did!" said the Hatter.
<P>
"I deny it!" said the March Hare.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/alice38.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
"He denies it," said the King: "leave out that part."
<P>
"Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said---" the Hatter went on, looking
anxiously round to see if he would deny it too; but the Dormouse denied
nothing, being fast asleep.
<P>
"After that," continued the Hatter, "I cut some more
bread-and-butter---"
<P>
"But what did the Dormouse say?" one of the jury asked.
<P>
"That I can't remember," said the Hatter.
<P>
"You <EM>must</EM> remember," remarked the King, "or I'll have you
executed."
<P>
The miserable Hatter dropped his teacut and bread-and-butter, and went
down on one knee. "I'm a poor man, your Majesty," he began.
<P>
"You're a <EM>very</EM> poor <EM>speaker</EM>," said the King.
<P>
Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by
the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just
explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied
up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,
head first, and then sat upon it.)
<P>
"I'm glad I've seen that done," thought Alice. "I've so often read in
the newspapers, at the end of trials, `There was some attempt at
applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
court,' and I never understood what it meant till now."
<P>
"If that's all you know about it, you may stand down," continued the
King.
<P>
"I can't go lower," said the Hatter: "I'm on the floor, as it is."
<P>
"Then they may <EM>sit</EM> down," the King replied.
<P>
Here the other guinea-pig cheered and was suppressed.
<P>
"Come, that finishes the guinea-pigs!" though Alice. "Now we shall get
on better."
<P>
"I'd rather finish my tea." said the Hatter, with an anxious look at
the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.
<P>
"You may go," said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,
without even waiting to put his shoes on.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/alice39.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
"---and just take this head off outside," the Queen added to one of
the officers; but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could
get to the door.
<P>
"Call the next witness!" said the King.
<P>
The next witness was the Duchess's coock. She carried the pepper-box in
her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.
<P>
"Give your evidence," said the King.
<P>
"Sha'n't," said the cook.
<P>
The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said, in a low voice,
"Your Majesty must cross-examine <EM>this</EM> witness."
<P>
"Well, if I must, I must," the King said with a melancholy air; and,
after foling his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly
out of sight, he said, in a deep voice, "What are tarts made of?"
<P>
"Pepper, mostly," said the cook.
<P>
"Treacle," said a sleepy voice behind her.
<P>
"Collar that Dormouse!" the Queen shrieked out. "Behead that
Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off
with his whiskers!"
<P>
For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse
turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had
dissapeared.
<P>
"Never mind!" said the King, with an air of great relief. "Call the
next witness." And, he added, in an under-tone to the Queen, "Really,
my dear, <EM>you</EM> must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes
my forehead ache!
<P>
Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very
curious to see what the next witness would be like,"---for they haven't
got much evidence <EM>yet</EM>," she said to herself. Imagine her
surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill
little voice, the name "Alice!"
