Looking-Glass Insects</A></H1>
<P>
OF course the first thing to do was make a
grand survey of the country she was going to
travel through.  "It's something very like learning
geography," thought Alice, as she stood on tiptoe
in hopes of being able to see a little further.
"Principal rivers--there <EM>are</EM> none.  Principal
mountains--I'm on the only one, but I don't think it's
got any name.  Principal towns--why, what <EM>are</EM>
those creatures, making honey down there?  They
can't be bees--nobody ever saw bees a mile off you
know---" and for some minutes she stood silent,
watching one of them that was bustling about
among the flowers, poking its proboscis into them,
"just as if it was a regular bee," thought Alice.
<P>
However, this was anything but a regular bee:
in fact, it was an elephant--as Alice soon found out,
though the idea quite took her breath away at first.
"And what enomous flowers they must be!" was
her next idea.  "Something like cottages with the
roofs taken off, and stalks put to them--and what
quantities of honey they must make!  I think I'll go
down and--no, I won't go <EM>just</EM> yet," she went on,
checking herself just as she was beginning to run
down the hill, and trying to find some excuse for
turning shy so suddenly.  "It'll never do to go down
among them without a good long branch to brush
them away--and what fun it'll be when they ask
me how I liked my walk.  I shall say--"Oh, I liked
it well enough---" (here came the favourite little
toss of the head), "only it was so dusty and hot,
and the elephants did tease so!"
<P>
"I think I'll go down the other way," she said
after a pause: "and perhaps I may visit the
elephants later on.  Besides, I do so want to get into
the Third Square!"
<P>
So with this excuse she ran down the hill and
jumped over the first six little brooks.
<P>
"Tickets, please!" said the Guard, putting his
head in at the window.  In a moment everybody
was holding out a ticket: they were about the same
size as the people, and quite seemed to fill the
carriage.
<P>
"Now then!  Show your ticket, child!" the Guard
went on, looking angrily at Alice.  And a great
many voices all said together ("like the chorus of a
song," thought Alice), "Don't keep him waiting,
child!  Why, his time is worth a thousand pounds a
minute!"
<P>
"I'm afraid I haven't got one," Alice said in a
frightened tone: "there wasn't a ticket-office where
I came from."  And again the chorus of voices
went on.  "There wasn't room for one where she
came from.  The land there is worth a thousand
pounds an inch!"
<P>
"Don't make excuses," said the Guard: "you
should have bought one from the engine-driver."
And once more the chorus of voices went on with
"The man that drives the engine.  Why, the smoke
alone is worth a thousand pounds a puff!"
<P>
Alice thought to herself, "Then there's no use in
speaking."  The voices didn't join in this time, as
she hadn't spoken, but, to her great surprise, they
all <EM>thought</EM> in chorus (I hope you understand what
<EM>thinking in chorus</EM> means--for I must confess that
I don't), "Better say nothing at all.  Language is
worth a thousand pounds a word!"
<P>
"I shall dream about a thousand pounds
tonight, I know I shall!" thought Alice.
<P>
All this time the Guard was looking at her, first
through a telescope, then through a microscope,
and then through an opera-glass.  At last he said,
"You're travelling the wrong way," and shut up
the window and went away.
<P>
"So young a child," said the gentleman sitting
opposite to her (he was dressed in white paper),
"ought to know which way she's going, even if she
doesn't know her own name!"
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/glass11.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
A Goat, that was sitting next to the gentleman in
white, shut his eyes and said in a loud voice, "She
ought to know her way to the ticket-office even if
she doesn't know her alphabet!"
<P>
There was a Beetle sitting next the Goat (it was
a very queer set of passengers altogether), and, as
the rule seemed to be that they should all speak in
turn, <EM>he</EM> went on with "She'll have to go back from
here as luggage!"
<P>
Alice couldn't see who was sitting beyond the
Beetle, but a hoarse voice spoke next. "'Change
engines---" it said, and there it choked and was
obliged to leave off.
<P>
"It sounds like a horse," Alice thought to herself.
And an extremely small voice, close to her ear,
said, "You might make a joke on that--
something about 'horse and hoarse', you know."
<P>
Then a very gentle voice in the distance said,
"She must be labelled "Lass, with care,' you
know----"
<P>
An  after that other voices went on ("What a
number of people there are in the carriage!"
thought Alice), saying, "She must go by post, as
she's got a head on her---" "She must be sent as
a message by the telegraph---" "She must draw
the train herself the rest of the way---" and so
on.
<P>
But the gentleman dressed in white paper leaned
forwards and whispered in her ear, "Never mind
what they all say, my dear, but take a return-ticket
every time the train stops."
<P>
"Indeed I shan't!"  Alice said rather impatiently.
"I don't belong to this railway journey at all--I
was in a wood just now--and I wish I could get
back there!"
<P>
"You might make a joke on that," said the little voice close to
her ear: "something about'you would, if you could', you know."
<P>
"Don't tease so," said Alice, looking about in
vain to see where the voice came from; "if you're so
anxious to have a joke made, why don't you make
one yourself?"
<P>
The little voice sighed deeply: it was <EM>very</EM>
unhappy, evidently, and Alice would have said
something pitying to comfort it, "if it would only sigh
like other people!" she thought.  But this was such
a wonderfully small sigh, that she wouldn't have
heard it at all, if it hadn't come <EM>quite</EM> close to her
ear.  The consequence of this was that it tickled her
ear very much, and quite took off her thoughts
from the unhappiness of the poor little creature.
<P>
"I know you are a  friend," the little voice went on: "a dear friend
and an old friend, And you won't hurt me, though I <EM>am</EM> an insect."
<P>
"What kind of insect?"  Alice inquired a little
anxiously.  What she really wanted to know was,
whether it could sting or not, but she thought this
wouldn't be quite a civil question to ask.
<P>
"What then you don't--" the little voice began, when it was
drowned by a shrill scream from the engine, and
everybody jumped up in alarm, Alice among the
rest.
<P>
The Horse, who had put his head out of the
window, quietly drew it in and said, "It's only a
brook we have to jump over."  Everybody seemed
satisfied with this, though Alice felt a little nervous
at the idea of trains jumping at all.  "However, it'll
take us into the Fourth Square, that's some
comfort!" she said to herself.  In another moment she
felt the carriage rise straight up into the air, and in
her fright, she caught at the thing nearest to her
hand, which happened to be the Goat's beard.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/glass12.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
But the beard seemed to melt away as she
touched it, and she found herself sitting quietly
under a tree--while the Gnat (for that was the
insect she had been talking to) was balancing itself
on a twig just over her head, and fanning her with
its wings.
<P>
It certainly was a <EM>very</EM> large Gnat: "about the
size of a chicken," Alice thought.  Still, she couldn't
feel nervous with it, after they had been talking
together so long.
"--then you don't like all insects?" the Gnat
went on, as quietly as if nothing had happened.
<P>
"I like them when they can talk," Alice said.
"None of them ever talk, where I come from."
<P>
"What sort of insects do you rejoice in, where <EM>you</EM>
come from?" the Gnat inquired.
<P>
"I don't <EM>rejoice</EM> in insects at all," Alice explained,
"because I'm rather afraid of them--at least the,
large kinds.  But I can tell you the names of some of
them."
<P>
"Of course they answer to their names?" the
Gnat remarked carelessly.
<P>
"I never knew them to do it."
<P>
"What's the use of their having names," the
Gnat said, "if they won't answer to them?"
<P>
"No use to <EM>them,</EM>" said Alice; "but it's useful to
the people that name them, I suppose.  If not, why
do things have names at all?"
<P>
"I can't say," said the Gnat.  "In the wood down
there, they've got no names--however, go on with
your list of insects."
<P>
"Well, there's the Horse-fly," Alice began,
counting off the names on her fingers
<P>
"All right," said the Gnat: "half-way up that
bush, you'll see a Rocking-horse-fly, if you look.
It's made entirely of wood, and gets about by
swinging itself from branch to branch."
<P>
"What does it live on?"  Alice asked, with great
curiosity.
<P>
"Sap and sawdust," said the Gnat.  "Go on with
the list."
<P>
Alice looked at the Rocking-horse-fly with great
" interest, and made up her mind that it must have
been just repainted, it looked so bright and sticky;
and then she went on.
<P>
"And there's the Dragon-fly."
<P>
"Look on the branch above your head," said the
Gnat, "and there you'll find a Snap-dragon-fly.
Its body is made of plum-pudding, its wings of
holly-leaves, and its head is a raisin burning in
brandy."
<P>
"And what does it live on?"  Allce asked, as
before.
<P>
"Frumenty and mince-pie," the Gnat replied;
"and it makes its nest in a Christmas-box."
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/glass13.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
"And then there's the Butterfly," Alice went on,
after she had taken a good look at the insect with
its head on fire, and had thought to herself, "I
wonder if that's the reason insects are so fond of
flying into candles--because they want to turn into
Snap-dragon-flies!"
<P>
"Crawling at your feet," said the Gnat (Alice
drew her feet back in some alarm), "you may
observe a Bread-and-butter-fly.  Its wings are thin
slices of bread-and-butter, its body is a crust, and
its head is a lump of sugar."
<P>
"And what does <EM>it</EM> live on?"
<P>
"Weak tea with cream in it."
<P>
A new difficulty came into Alice's head.  "S
upposing it couldn't find any?" she suggested.
<P>
"Then it would die, of course."
<P>
"But that must happen very often," Alice
remarked thoughtfully.
<P>
"It always happens," said the Gnat.
<P>
After this, Alice was silent for a minute or two,
pondering.  The Gnat amused itself meanwhile by
humming round and round her head: at last it
settled again and remarked, "I suppose you don't
want to lose your name?"
<P>
"No, indeed," Alice said, a little anxious
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/glass14.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
"And yet I don't know," the Gnat went on in a
careless tone: "only think how convenient it would
be if you could manage to go home without it.  For
instance, if the governess wanted to call you to your
lesson, she would call out, "Come here--," and
there she would have to leave off, because there
wouldn't be any name for her to call and of course
you wouldn't have to go, you know."
<P>
"That would never do, I'm sure," said Alice:
"the governess would never think of excusing me
lessons for that.  If she couldn't.  remember my
name, she'd call me 'Miss!' as the servants do."
<P>
"Well, if she said "Miss,' and didn't say anything
more," the Gnat remarked, "of course you'd miss
your lessons.  That's a joke.  I wish <EM>you</EM> had made
it."
<P>
"Why do you wish I had made it?"  Alice asked.
"It's a very bad one."
<P>
But the Gnat only sighed deeply, while two large
tears came rolling down its cheeks.
<P>
"You shouldn't make jokes," Alice said, "if it
makes you so unhappy."
<P>
Then came another of those melancholy little
sighs, and this time the poor Gnat really seemed to
have sighed itself away, for, when Alice looked up,
there was nothing whatever to be seen on the twig,
and, as she was getting quite chilly with sitting still
so long, she got up and walked on.
<P>
She very soon came to an open field with a wood
on the other side of it: it looked much darker than
the last wood, and Alice felt a <EM>little</EM> timid about
going into it.  However, on second thoughts, she
made up her mind to go on: "for I certainly won't
go <EM>back,</EM>" she thought to herself, and this was the
only way to the Eighth Square.
<P>
"This must be the wood," she said thoughtfully
to herself, "where things have no names, I wonder
what'll become of <EM>my</EM> name when I go in?  I
shouldn't like to lose it at all--because they'd have
to give me another, and it would be almost certain
to be an ugly one.  But then the fun would be,
trying to find the creature that had got my old name!
That's just like the advertisements, you know, when
people lose dogs--"<EM>answers to the name of "Dash":</EM>
<EM>had on a brass collar"--</EM> just fancy calling everything
you met "Alice, till one of them answered!  Only
they wouldn't answer at all, if they were wise."
<P>
She was rambling on in this way when she
reached the wood: it looked very cool and shady.
"Well, at any rate it's a great comfort," she said as
she stepped under the trees, "after being so hot, to
get into the--into the--into <EM>what?</EM>" she went on,
rather surprised at not being able to think of the
word.  "I mean to get under the--under the--under
<EM>this,</EM> you know!" putting her hand on the trunk of
the tree.  "What <EM>does</EM> it call itself?  I do believe it's
got no name--why, to be sure it hasn't!"
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/glass15.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
She stood silent for a minute, thinking: then she
suddenly began again.  "Then it really has
happened, after all!  And now, who am I?  I <EM>will</EM>
remember, if I can!  I'm determined to do it!"  But
being detemined didn't help her much, and all she
could say, after a great deal of puzzling, was, "L,
I <EM>know</EM> it begins with L!"
<P>
Just then a Fawn came wandering by: it looked
at Alice with its large eyes, but didn't seem
at all frightened.  "Here then!  Here then!"  Alice
said, as she held out her hand and tried to stroke it:
but it only started back a little, and then stood
looking at her again.
<P>
"What do you call yourself?" the Fawn said at
last.  Such a soft sweet voice it had!
<P>
"I wish I knew!" thought poor Alice.  She
answered, rather sadly, "Nothing, just now."
<P>
"Think again," it said: "thatwo'n't do."
<P>
Alice thought, but nothing came of it.  "Please,
would you tell me what <EM>you</EM> call yourself?" she said
timidly.  "I think that might help a little."
<P>
"I'll tell you, if you'll come a little further on,"
the Fawn said. "I can't remember here."
<P>
So they walked on together through the wood,
Alice with her arms clasped lovingly round the soft
neck of the Fawn, till they came out into another
open field, and here the Fawn gave a sudden bound
into the air, and shook itself free from Alice's arms.
"And, dear me, you're a human child!"  A sudden
look of alarm came into its beautiful brown eyes and
in another moment it had darted away at full speed.
<P>
Alice stood looking after it, almost ready to cry
with vexation at having lost her dear little
fellowtraveller so suddenly- "However, I know my name
now," she said: "that's some comfort.  Alice--Alice--I
won't forget it again.  And now, which of these
finger-posts ought I to follow, I wonder?"
<P>
It was not a difficult question to answer, as there
was only one road, and the finger-posts both
pointed along it.  "I'll settle it," Alice said to
herself, "when the road divides and they point different
ways.
<P>
But this did not seem likely to happen.  She went
on and on, a long way, but wherever the road
divided there were sure to be two finger-posts
pointing the same way, one marked "TO TWEEDLEDUM'S
HOUSE," and the other "TO THE HOUSE OF TWEEDLEDEE."
<P>
"I do believe," said Alice at last, "that they live
in the same house!  I wonder I never thought of
that before--but I can't stay there long.  I'll just
call and say "How d'ye do?' and ask them the way
out of the wood.  If I could only get to the Eighth
square before it gets dark!"  So she wandered on,
talking to herself as she went, till, on turning a
sharp corner, she came upon two fat little men, so
suddenly that she could not help starting back, but
in another moment she recovered herself, feeling
sure that they must be---
