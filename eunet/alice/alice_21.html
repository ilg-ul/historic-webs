The Garden of Live Flowers</A></H1>
<P>
"I SHOULD see the garden far better," said Alice
to herself, "if I could get to the top of that hill:
and here's a path that leads straight to it--at least,
no, it doesn't do that---" (after going a few yards
along the path, and turinng several sharp corners),
"but I suppose it will at last.  But how curiously it
twists!  It's more like a corkscrew than a path!
Well, <EM>this</EM> turn goes to the hill, I suppose--no, it
doesn't!  This goes straight back to the house!
Well then, I'll try it the other way."
<P>
And so she did: wandering up and down, and
"trying turn after turn, but always coming back
to the house, do what she would.  Indeed, once,
when she turned a corner rather more quickly than
usual, she ran against it before she couId stop
herself.
<P>
"It's no use talking about it," Alice said, looking
up at the house and pretending it was arguing with
her.  "I'm <EM>not</EM> going in again yet.  I know I should
have to get through the Looking-glass again--back
into the old room--and there'd be an end of all my
adventures!"
<P>
So, resolutely turning her back upon the house
she set out once more down the path, determined to
keep straight on till she got to the hill.  For a few
minutes all went on well, and she was just saying,
"I really <EM>shall</EM> do it this time---" when the path
gave a sudden twist and shook itself (as she
described it afterwards), and the next moment she
found herself actually walking in at the door.
<P>
"Oh, it's too bad!" she cried.  "I never saw such
a house for getting in the way!  Never!"
<P>
However, there was the hill full in sight, so there
ywas nothing to be done but start again.  This time
she came upon a large flower-bed, with a border of
daisies, and a willow-tree growing in the middle.
<P>
"O Tiger-lily," said Alice, addressing herself to
one that was waving gracefully about in the wind,
"I <EM>wish</EM> you could talk!"
<P>
"We <EM>can</EM> talk," said the Tiger-lily: "when there's
anybody worth talking to."
<P>
Alice was so astonished that she couldn't speak
for a minute: it quite seemed to take her breath
away.  At length, as the Tiger-lily only went on
waving about, she spoke again, in a timid voice--
almost in a whisper. "And can <EM>all</EM> the flowers
talk?"
<P>
"As well as <EM>you</EM> can," said the Tiger-lily.  "And a
great deal louder."
<P>
"It isn't manners for us to begin, you know," said
the Rose, "and I really was wondering when you'd
speak!  Said I to myself.  "Her face has got <EM>some</EM>
sense in it, though it's not a clever one!' Still
you're the right colour, and that goes a long
way."
<P>
"I don't care about the colour," the Tiger-lily
remarked.  "If only her petals curled up a little
more, she'd be all right."
<P>
Alice didn't like being criticised, so she began
asking questions: "Aren't you sometimes frightened
at being planted out here, with nobody to take care
of you?"
<P>
"There's the tree in the middle," said the Rose.
"What else is it good for?"
<P>
"But what could it do, if any danger came?"
Alice asked.
<P>
"It could bark," said the Rose.
<P>
"It says "Bough-wough," cried a Daisy: "that's
why its branches are called boughs!"
<P>
"Didn't you know <EM>that?</EM>" cried another Daisy,
and here they all began shouting together, till the
air seemed quite full of little shrill voices.  "Silence,
every one of you!" cried the Tiger-lily, waving itself
passionately from side to side, and trembling with
excitement.  "They know I can't get at them!"
panted, bending its quivering head towards Alice,
"or they wouldn't dare do it!"
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/glass07.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
"Never mind!"  Alice said in a soothing tone, and
stooping down to the daisies, who were just be
ginning again, she whispered, "If you don't hold
your tongues, I'll pick you!"
<P>
There was silence in a moment, and several of the
pink daisies turned white.
<P>
"That's right!" said the Tiger-lily.  "The daisies
are worst of all.  When one speaks, they all begin
together, and it's enough to make one wither to
hear the way they go on!"
<P>
"How is it you can all talk so nicely?"  Alice said,
hoping to get it into a better temper by a
compliment.  "I've been in many gardens before, but
none of the flowers could talk."
<P>
"Put your hand down, and feel the ground," said
the Tiger-lily.  "Then you'll know why."
<P>
Alice did so.  "It's very hard," she said, "but I
don't see what that has to do with it."
<P>
"In most gardens," the Tiger-lily said, "they
make the beds too soft--so that the flowers are
always asleep."
<P>
This sounded a very good reason, and Alice was
quite pleased to know it.  "I never thought of that
before!" she said.
<P>
"It's <EM>my</EM> opinion you never think <EM>at all,</EM>" the
Rose said in a rather severe tone.
<P>
"I never saw anybody that looked stupider," a
Violet said, so suddenly, that Alice quite jumped;
for it hadn't spoken before.
<P>
"Hold <EM>your</EM> tongue!" cried the Tiger-lily.  "As
if <EM>you</EM> ever saw anybody!  You keep your head
under the leaves, and snore away there till you
know no more what's going on in the world, than if
you were a bud!"
<P>
"Are there any more people in the garden besides
me?"  Alice said, not choosing to notice the Rose's
last remark.
<P>
"There's one other flower in the garden that can
move about like you," said the Rose.  "I wonder
how you do it---" ("You're always wondering,"
said the Tiger-lily), "but she's more bushy than you
are."
<P>
"Is she like me?"  Alice asked eagerly, for the
thought crossed her mind.  "There's another little
girl in the garden somewhere!"
<P>
"Well, she has the same awkward shape as you,"
the Rose said: "but she's redder--and her petals
are shorter, I think."
<P>
"They're done up close, like a dahlia," said the Tiger-lily:
"not tumbled about, like yours."
<P>
"But that's not <EM>your</EM> fault," the Rose added
kindly: "you're beginning to fade, you know--and
then one can't help one's petals getting a little
untidy."
<P>
Alice didn't like this idea at all: so, to change
the subject, she asked, "Does she ever come out
here ?"
<P>
"I daresay you'll see her soon," said the Rose,
"She's one of the thorny kind."
<P>
"Where does she wear the thorns?"  Alice asked
with some curiosity.
<P>
"Why, all round her head, of course," the Rose
replied.  "I was wondering <EM>you</EM> hadn't got some too.
I thought it was the regular rule."
<P>
"She's coming!" cried the Larkspur.  "I hear her
footstep, thump, thump, along the gravel-walk!"
<P>
Alice looked round eagerly, and found that it was
the Red Queen.  "She's grown a good deal!" was
her first remark.  She had indeed: when Alice first
found her in the ashes, she had been only three
inches high--and here she was, half a head taller
than Alice herself!
<P>
"It's the fresh air that does it," said the Rose:
"wonderfully fine air it is, out here."
<P>
"I think I'll go and meet her," said Alice, for,
though the flowers were very interesting, she felt
that it would be far grander to have a talk with a
real Queen.
<P>
"You can't possibly do that," said the Rose: "<EM>I</EM>
should advise you to walk the other way."
<P>
This sounded nonsense to Alice so she said
nothing, but set off at once towards the Red Queen.
To her surprise, she lost sight of her in a moment,
and found herself walking in at the front-door
again.
<P>
A little provoked, she drew back and, after
looking everywhere for the Queen (whom she spied out
at last, a long way off), she thought she would try
the plan, this time, of walking in the opposite
direction.
<P>
It succeeded beautifully.  She had not been
walking a minute before she found herself face to face
with the Red Queen, and full in sight of the hill she
had been so long aiming at.
<P>
"Where do you come from?" said the Red
Queen.  "And where are you going?  Look up,
speak nicely, and don't twiddle your fingers all the
time."
<P>
Alice attended to all these directions, and
explained, as well as she could, that she had lost her
way.
<P>
"I don't know what you mean by <EM>your</EM> way,"
said the Queen: "all the ways about here belong to
<EM>me--</EM>but why did you come out here at all?" she
added in a kinder tone.  "Curtsey while you're
thinking what to say.  It saves time."
<P>
Alice wondered a little at this, but she was too
much in awe of the Queen to disbelleve it.  "I'll try
it when I go home," she thought to herself, "the
next time I'm a little late for dinner."
<P>
"It's time for you to answer now," the Queen
said, looking at her watch: "open your mouth a
<EM>little</EM> wider when you speak, and aiways say "your
Majesty."
<P>
"I only wanted to see what the garden was like,
your Majesty---"
<P>
"That's right," said the Queen, patting her on the
head, which Alice didn't like at all: "though, when
you say "garden,' <EM>I've</EM> seen gardens, compared with
which this would be a wilderness."
<P>
Alice didn't dare to argue the point, but went
on: "--and I thought I'd try and find my way to
the top of that hill---"
<P>
"When you say "hill,' " the Queen interrupted,
"I could show you hills, in comparison with which
you'd call that a valley."
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/glass08.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
"No, I shouldn't," said Alice, surprised into
contradicting her at last: "a hill <EM>can't</EM> be a valley, you
know, That would be nonsense---"
<P>
The Red Queen shook her head.  "You may call
it `nonsense' if you llke," she said, "but <EM>I've</EM> heard
nonsense, compared with which that would be as
sensible as a dictionary!"
<P>
Alice curtseyed again, as she was afraid from the
Queen's tone that she was a <EM>little</EM> offended: and
they walked on in silence till they got to the top of
the little hill.
<P>
For some minutes Alice stood without speaking,
looking out in all directions over the country--and
a most curious country it was.  There were a
number of little brooks running across from side to
side, and the ground between was divided up into
squares by a number of hedges, that reached from
brook to brook.
<P>
"I declare it's marked out just like a large
chessboard!"  Alice said at last.  "There ought to be some
men moving about somewhere--and so there are!"
she added in a tone of delight, and her heart began
to beat quick with excitement as she went on.  "It's
a great game of chess that's being played--all over
the world--if this <EM>is</EM> the world at all, you know.
Oh, what fun it is!  How I <EM>wish</EM> I was one of them!
don't mind being a Pawn, if only I might join--
though of course I should <EM>like</EM> to be a Queen,
best."
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/glass09.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
She glanced rather shyly at the real Queen as she
said this, but her companion only smiled pleasantly,
and said, "That's easily managed.  You can be the
White Queen's Pawn, if you like, as Lily's too young
to play; and you're in the Second Square to begin
with: when you get into the Eighth Square you'll
be a Queen---" Just at this moment, somehow or
other, they began to run.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/glass10.gif" ALT="[PICTURE]">
<P>
Alice never could quite make out, in thinking it
over afterwards, how it was that they began: all she
remembers is, that they were running hand in hand,
and the Queen went so fast that it was all she could
do to keep up with her: and still the Queen kept
crying "Faster!" but Alice felt she <EM>could not</EM> go
faster, though she had no breath to say so.
<P>
The most curious part of the thing was, that the
trees and the other things round them never
changed their places at all: however fast they went,
they never seemed to pass anything.  "I wonder if
all the things move along with us?" thought poor
puzzled Alice.  And the Queen seemed to guess her
thoughts, for she cried, "Faster!  Don't try to
talk!"
<P>
Not that Alice had any idea of doing <EM>that.</EM> She
felt as if she would never be able to talk again, she
was getting so out of breath: and still the Queen
cried, "Faster!  Faster!" and dragged her along.
"Are we nearly there?"  Alice managed to pant out
at last.
<P>
"Nearly there!" the Queen repeated.  "Why, we
passed it ten minutes ago!  Faster!"  And they ran
on for a time in silence, with the wind whistling in
Alice's ears, and almost blowing her hair off her
head, she fancied.
<P>
"Now!  Now!" cried the Queen.  "Faster!
Faster!"  And they went so fast that at last they
seemed to skim through the air, hardly touching
the ground with their feet, till suddenly, just as
Alice was getting quite exhausted, they stopped,
and she found herself sitting on the ground,
breathless and giddy.
<P>
The Queen propped her against a tree, and said
kindly, "You may rest a little now."
<P>
Alice looked round her in great surprise.  "Why,
I do believe we've been under this tree all the time!
Everything's just as it was!"
<P>
"Of course it is," said the Queen: "what would
you have it?"
<P>
"Well, in <EM>our</EM> country," said Alice, still panting a
little, "you'd generally get to somewhere else--if
you ran very fast for a long time, as we've been
doing."
<P>
"A slow sort of country!" said the Queen.
"Now, <EM>here,</EM> you see, it takes all the running you
can do, to keep in the same place.  If you want to
get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as
fast as that!"
<P>
"I'd rather not try, please!" said Alice.  "I'm
quite content to stay here--only I <EM>am</EM> so hot and
thirsty!  "
<P>
"I know what <EM>you'd</EM> like!" the Queen said
goodnaturedly, taking a little box out of her pocket,
"Have a biscuit?"
<P>
Alice thought it would not be civil to say "No,"
though it wasn't at all what she wanted.  So she
took it, and ate it as well as she could: and it was
<EM>very</EM> dry; and she thought she had never been so
nearly choked in all her life.
<P>
"While you're refreshing yourself," said the
Queen, "I'll just take the measurements."  And she
took a ribbon out of her pocket, marked in inches,
and began measuring out the ground, and sticking
little pegs in here and there.
<P>
"At the end of two yards," she said, putting in a
peg to mark the distance, "I shall give you your
directions--have another biscuit?"
<P>
"No, thank you," said Alice: "one's <EM>quite</EM>
enough!"
<P>
"Thirst quenched, I hope?" said the Queen.
<P>
Alice did not know what to say to this, but
luckily the Queen did not wait for an answer, but
went on.  "At the end of <EM>three</EM> yards I shall repeat
them--for fear of your forgetting them.  At the end
of <EM>four,</EM> I shall say good-bye.  And at the end of
<EM>five,</EM> I shall go!"
<P>
She had got all the pegs put in by this time, and
Alice looked on with great interest as she returned
to the tree, and then began slowly walking down
the row.
<P>
At the two-yard peg she faced round, and said,
"A pawn goes two squares in its first move So
you'll go <EM>very</EM> quickly through the Third Square--
by railway, I should think--and you'll find
yourself in the Fourth Square in no time.  Well, <EM>that</EM>
square belongs to Tweedledum and Tweedledee--
the Fifth is mostly water--the Sixth belongs to
Humpty Dumpty--but you make no remark?"
<P>
"I--I didn't know I had to make one--just then "
Alice faltered out.
<P>
"You <EM>should</EM> have said," the Queen went on in a
tone of grave reproof, " "It's extremely kind of you
to tell me all this'--however, we'll suppose it said
--the Seventh Square is all forest--however, one of
the Knights will show you the way--and in the
Eighth Square we shall be Queens together, and it's
all feasting and fun!"  Alice got up and curtseyed,
and sat down again.
<P>
At the next peg the Queen turned again, and said,
"Speak in French when you can't think of the
English for a thing--turn out your toes as you walk
--and remember who you are!"  She did not wait
for Alice to curtsey this time, but walked on quickly
to the next peg, where she turned to say "good-bye,"
and then hurried on to the last.
<P>
How it happened, Allce never knew, but exactly
as she came to the last peg, she was gone.  Whether
she vainshed into the air, or ran quickly into the
wood ("and she <EM>can</EM> run very fast!" thought Alice),
there was no way of guessing, but she was gone, and
Alice began to remember that she was a Pawn, and
that it would soon be time to move.
