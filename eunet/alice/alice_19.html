<P>
As the chess-problem, given on the previous page, has puzzled some of
my readers, it may be well to explain that it is exactly worked out, so
far as the <EM>moves</EM> are concerned. The <EM>alternation</EM> of Red and
White is perhaps not so strictly observed as it might be, and the
"castling" of the three Queens is merely a way of saying that they
entered the palace; but the "check" of the White King at move 6, the
capture of the Red Knight at move 7, and the final "checkmate" of the
Red King, will be found, by any one who will take the trouble to set the
pieces and play the moves as directed, to be strictly in accordance with the
laws of the game.
<P>
The new words, in the poem "Jabberwocky" (see p. 134), have given
rise to some differences of opinion as to their pronounciation: so it may
be well to give instructions on <EM>that</EM> point also.
Pronounce "slithy" as if it were two words "sly, the": make the "g"
<EM>hard</EM> in "gyre" and "gimble": and pronounce "rath" to rhyme with
"bath".
<P>
For this sixty-first thousand, fresh electrotypes have been taken from
the wood-blocks (which, never having been used for printing from, are
in as good condition as when first cut in 1871), and the whole book has
been set up afresh with new type. If the artistic qualities of this reissue
fall short, in any particular, of those possessed by the original issue,
it will not be for want of painstaking on the part of author, publisher,
or printer.
<P>
I take this opportunity of announcing that the Nursery "Alice", hitherto
priced at four shillings, net, is now to be had on the same terms as the
ordinary shilling picture-books--although I feel sure that it is, in
every quality (exept the <EM>text</EM> itself, in which I am not qualified
to pronounce), greatly superior to them.
Four shillings was a perfectly reasonalble price to charge, considering
the very heavy initial outlay I had incurred: still, as the Public have
practically said, "We will <EM>not</EM> give more than a shilling for a
picture-book, however artistically got-up," I am content to reckon my
outlay on the book as so much dead loss, amd, rather than let the little
ones, for whom it was written, go without it, I am selling it at a price
which is, to me, much the same thing as <EM>giving</EM> it away.
<P>
<EM>Christmas,</EM> 1896.
